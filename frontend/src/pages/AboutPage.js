          <p>
            We believe that writing is an intimate projection of an author's mind. The Writer Analysis Tool is designed to provide insights into writing styles and an authors personality using advanced language processing techniques. 
            Our goal is to help writers understand their unique voice and compare it with others in the literary world. We also believe this technique can be used to understand how you are uniquely differentiated in the sea of other writers.
