Fears of an AI Bubble Seem Overhyped: A Rebuttal to the Goldman and Sequoia Reports,https://travismay.medium.com/fears-of-an-ai-bubble-seem-overhyped-a-rebuttal-to-the-goldman-and-sequoia-reports-7fa70fa351f2?source=rss-519ecefb7852------2,"A few weeks ago, Goldman Sachs and Sequoia published reports ( here and here ) that presented some skepticism about an AI-fueled rally for markets and the economy. They were well-reasoned, nuanced articles, and diverged from the groupthink that has emerged about AI over the last two years — and have helped trigger a shift in mood that has driven a light market pullback around AI. The papers fundamentally argue that generative AI is overhyped as a driver of market returns because i) the technology is only being used for efficiency gains (which will be competed away as sources of profit) and not driving new revenue streams to justify the investments, and ii) the costs and quality of AI technology aren’t improving fast enough to drive widespread adoption for the use cases imagined. There were several points they made that I found salient: Generative AI has more use cases around automation and cost reduction than use cases that generate revenue. The superpower for this technology is to give humans leverage in automating existing tasks, and every major use case that has gotten traction to date has been about efficiency. As a result, AI users should see the promise of AI as lower costs rather than higher revenue. The profit improvements from many cost-reduction initiatives will be competed away over time. Over a few year period, AI laggards will likely catch up with AI early-adopters, and efficiency gains will no longer result in greater profits (the benefits will instead be largely passed along to consumers in most industries). For example, if an airline figures out a great AI call center that reduces its customer service fees, all other airlines will eventually figure this out, and it will ultimately work its way into lower ticket prices rather than higher profitability for airlines. Much of today’s AI revenue isn’t yet sustainable: it is either “innovation showcase” (companies and individuals trying to show off innovation rather than real applications) or AI companies buying from AI companies. A variety of issues hold back widespread adoption: accuracy/hallucination issues, price, and the fundamentals of any technology change (internal realignment, alignment of vendor ecosystem, security and regulatory reviews, procurement processes, etc.). I think these constraints are real, and is the most compelling argument against AI hype — as it is fundamentally a timing question of when real use cases will emerge. Many of the AI businesses emerging don’t have great defensibility (i.e. “Automation for X” can often be built by many startups simultaneously), and as a result won’t be able to build incredibly valuable new companies that drive new revenue streams. AGI is overhyped. Despite the excitement of enthusiasts, there is little evidence that we’re heading towards a world where AI accelerates this much. There are going to be micro-bubbles and frenzies along the way. Even if AI as a whole does make a major impact, any of the specific companies hyped will quite possibly fail, and the market will probably go through waves. I believe all of the points above are correct. In the past, I’ve said that my base case is that there will be a 2–5x surge in American productivity in the next decade as a result of AI, and as a result we should act like this is 1995 — and that we’re in the early stages of a sustained shift in markets. So how do those views align? What I think was missing in the logic of these papers: Unlike many speculative bubbles (eg. crypto, in my view) — the killer use cases are real and near-term. Lots of real use cases are already viable — but take time to become enterprise ready. Many aspects of call center automation, customer service automation, programming, legal document mining, and medical billing automation have clearly-viable automation use cases that will have widespread adoption in the next year or two. Moreover, a huge number of automation use cases are on the precipice of viability, and a small change in the accuracy or cost can push them into feasibility. Meanwhile, the underlying technology is continuing to improve rapidly, and a Moore’s Law type progress seems like a reasonable trajectory. So the boom in real use cases a couple years out seems likely. While many AI-related efficiency gains will be competed away, they will make existing moats and network effects even more valuable — and distribution channels will become more valuable. For example, if you automated away 5% of the expenses of every insurance company in America by improving back-office processes, while much of that gain would be passed along to consumers, I expect that insurers would capture some of the improved margins based on their existing moats. A new set of companies that provide core infrastructure and complimentary components for AI will pick up revenue. This is the tailwind that NVIDIA and big tech is riding, and it also applies to a variety of startups. Consumers will accrue most benefits, and that will benefit a wide variety of companies in the market. If consumers become more wealthy, they will buy more of a wide variety of products. So even areas like real estate or retail could end up major beneficiaries of AI. To recap — in a world where everyone improves productivity by 2–5x, I would expect markets would do well in aggregate, even if AI doesn’t create new revenue streams for incumbents but just helps them boost efficiency. The beneficiaries would be: Consumers will reap most of the gains — and in turn spend more on a variety of non-AI products Incumbents with good moats will keep some of the gains — and the companies that adopt AI ahead-of-market may be able to use the transition period to deepen their moats New infrastructural components for AI use cases Investors that systematically back #2 and #3. In particular, VC (and public markets for big tech) are making big bets or #3, and some PE firms are looking at #2 as a generational “digital transformation” opportunity. So, ultimately, even though AI’s economic impact may just be about efficiency gains, and even though the majority of the returns might not go to the industries where AI has the biggest impact (as they get competed away), the gains to the economy, consumers, investors, and builders will be very real — and if anything, there is still an under-appreciation in markets of the long-term impact of this.","Thu, 25 Jul 2024 20:08:20 GMT"
How to build a great product delivery team,https://travismay.medium.com/how-to-build-a-great-product-delivery-team-4cc0beba5292?source=rss-519ecefb7852------2,"When enterprise tech companies reach hypergrowth and are scaling quickly, much of their ultimate success comes down to maintaining high net retention rates, low churn, happy customers, and the ability to systematically deliver a repeatable product. Much of this lies in the hands of one of the most undervalued teams in the company: the product delivery team. Unfortunately, the vast majority of companies treat product delivery mostly as an afterthought and cost center (or area to throw bodies) rather than a central asset. Whether dubbed “delivery,” “forward deployed engineers,” “customer service,” “technical account management,” or (my personal favorite) “product success,” the delivery team is the last-mile bridge between the promise of your product and actual use of your product. It is also the central node of information flow — often receiving more direct customer feedback than your Product Managers and developing a more intuitive sense of the customer value proposition than your Account Execs. It is one of the most undervalued and most critical functions in any technology company. One of my takeaways in building both LiveRamp and Datavant was to work hard on building an incredible Product Success function — which helped us have a lean team and 150+% net retention rates during key moments of growth. Here is the playbook I developed: Hire overqualified people Make the charter of the team to i) delight clients, ii) find ways to create leverage, and iii) find ways to improve the product — in that order Use distribution lists for visibility (including CEO visibility) Watch your ratios Celebrate the wins Situate the team under Product Management with pods matrixed into Customer Success Don’t worry about end-to-end self-service Don’t hide behind support@ Default to escalation so that bad news travels fast Obsess over automation and expanding leverage for the team More on each lesson below. *** Lesson 1: Hire overqualified people At both Datavant and LiveRamp, product delivery was one of our best talent pipelines for exceptional generalists into the company. Externally, this ‘overqualified’ talent delighted customers, connecting the dots in customer demand to advocate for product features and proactively building leverage. Clients felt like they were speaking to someone empowered, determined, and sharp to help solve their problems — and enjoyed the experience of working with us as a result. Internally, the function served many of the benefits of a rotational program: team members left as experts on the product suite, customer evangelists, and with trust based relationships across Sales, Product, and Engineering. Several executives at Datavant & LiveRamp started in the Product Success function, as did most of the Product Management team, and even some engineers and sales reps. And hiring exceptional talent also allowed us to keep the headcount lean — which kept us more nimble. Lesson 2: Make the charter of the team i) delight clients, ii) find ways to create leverage, iii) find ways to improve the product — in that order. Start with “do what it takes to delight our clients.” Defining ‘delight clients’ broadly expands the mindset from ‘answering these customer tickets’ to ‘my job is to make the system work,’ leading to parts ii) and iii) of the charter. With this three-part charter, delivery team members are empowered (and expected) to think more broadly than their individual account lists — automating their role and advocating for product improvements. Case in point: at both Datavant and LiveRamp, many of our “new” products would start as a feature request from a specific client, and a Delivery Lead would see it, realize the generalizability of the idea, and champion investing in it (and usually figure out some hacky way to get it delivered to the client that requested). The key is to do this for just the ideas that actually ought to be productized; so a great Delivery Lead would understand the frontier of our product, our overall strategy, and clients extremely well — and would know what to champion to PMs. The relative priority of the responsibilities of the charter matter: when in conflict, delighting the individual customer should matter most for this function. But investing in delighting specific customers should be seen as necessary as not sufficient; most delivery functions fail to tap into the full potential of the team by narrowly defining the charter and limiting the agency of the team. Lesson 3: Use distribution lists for visibility (including CEO visibility) One of my all-time favorite CEO hacks is the use of customer aliases to enable rapid information sharing and radical transparency. Take a customer called “AcmeCo”. At Datavant and LiveRamp, all communications to anyone at AcmeCo would cc an email address like acmeco@datavant.com or acmeco@liveramp.com, which was in turn a listserv for all team members (sales, customer success, delivery) watching the AcmeCo account. At face value, this enabled institutional knowledge continuity, eliminated single points of failure, and facilitated real-time cross-functional communication and problem-solving. Perhaps more valuable is the gateway customer aliases created for me as CEO to manage by random sampling — tracking a small number of random projects to gauge how things were going in general. Customer communications are an unadulterated microcosm of the health of the business. How are customers actually using the product? Where are the issues coming up? Aliases create a door to valuable first hand data often buried in customer service tickets. What’s more, passively (but never secretly) watching distribution lists helped foster a culture of excellence, urgency, and visibility that ambitious doers (see #1) crave. Lesson 4: Watch your ratios The default on any team is to incrementally scale with people rather than enabling process or automation — everyone is too busy to automate. On Delivery teams, leanness as an operating principle is not just a cost-cutting strategy but broader cultural default towards automation. Hiring fewer, costlier, ‘overqualified’ delivery leads necessitates that each lead carry significantly more accounts, in turn creating the cultural incentive for building leverage. A good rule of thumb that I used here was that each person on the product success team should be able to support a ~$2M account load. Of course we were adding people to the team as the company scaled rapidly, but keeping this rough ratio in mind made automation front-and-center throughout the growth process (and kept our margins high). Lesson 5: Celebrate the wins Delivery jobs are inherently challenging. You’re the first point of contact when a product isn’t working, you bear the brunt of any ‘Sales selling ahead of the Product’ dynamic, and at low points you feel accountable for delighting customers without the decision-making power to always make the desired changes. You’re often the one personally ‘falling on the grenade’ for a team failure. Especially in this function, maintaining morale becomes a core organizational strategy. Adopting a cohort model (a team of high potential talent, whose commiseration leads to deep friendships) is a strong morale boosting tactic. Feeling a sense of ownership within the company, and a path for personal growth is critical. Leadership working side-by-side in the major firefights is another tactic. But celebrating wins is the easiest critical tactic. Given the non-obvious celebration milestones in contrast to other functions (Sales has deals, PMs have product launches, etc.), we invested in ritualizing wins. We made Delivery Leads visible — at all hands, hackathons, customer events, Delivery team members were chosen as speakers, judges, and facilitators. We elevated what otherwise might be ‘non-events’ — migrating the final customers from V2 to V3 of the software — to major team celebrations. Every “deal won” email sent by the sales team had a section to celebrate the delivery team. Lesson 6: Situate the team under Product Development with pods matrixed into Customer Success As the team grows, most companies end up putting delivery under Customer Success. I think this is usually a mistake: situating the customer service/ delivery/ implementations team under the Product team forces Product to internalize constraints on how polished the product should be, and removed from the immediate customer feedback. The delivery team is the ‘last-mile services’ side of a SaaS business. They build last-mile integrations, manually support features that have yet to be productized, and fight bugs when the product experience doesn’t meet the product promise. The Product Leader should be forced to internalize tradeoffs: should I prioritize productizing XYZ features that the delivery team is manually providing on Q4 roadmap or focus on net new functionality? Who should I hire — another PM or another Delivery Lead, and what has to be true about the product if it needs to scale with fewer Delivery Leads? Having deep relationships with the go-to-market team is also critical for the success of the delivery team. Creating cross-functional pods (e.g., a pod that brings together Sales, Customer Success, and Delivery for a specific customer type) enables a horizontal Delivery team to stay tightly coupled with the relevant Customer Success and Sales teams. Lesson 7: Don’t worry about end-to-end self-service Product teams & CEOs generally envision the perfect end-to-end self-service business, and this is great when it’s possible. However, more often than not, end-to-end pure self-service is not the right aspiration for complex enterprise SAAS businesses: configurability (rather than pure standardization) is too important in an enterprise context to make extremely simple UIs and workflows. And the ability to nimbly add in new features strains this even further if you need to immediately roll out full self-service. Instead of letting perfect be the enemy of the good, with limited resources, it often makes sense to create a 95% automated workflow, and then tools that give leverage to the internal team to do the last-mile delivery. For example, a great ETL wizard that makes it easy for an internal implementations team to seamlessly ingest data in the right format is often better than forcing customers to standardize their formats, or learn a complex wizard themselves. By investing pragmatically in a mostly-automated function, you can generally build a higher-margin, more nimble, and more configurable product than investing in end-to-end automation. Lesson 8: Don’t hide behind support@ While I’m a staunch advocate of customer aliases (see #3), sending messages from a generic support@ alias instead of a human owner dilutes customer delight and distracts from clear account ownership. Starting from a place of delighting the customer means that any customer paying 250k+/ year has a known point of contact and, ideally, a growing trusted relationship with that contact. Internally, a clear point of contact becomes accountable holistically for the customer’s success, getting to know the client’s needs more deeply. A generic support@ becomes a crutch, enabling poor role clarity. Support@ too easily becomes a blackhole of follow ups and finger pointing. It’s not worth it — customer aliases (see #4) provide the benefit of organizational continuity without the dilution of accountability. Lesson 9: Default to escalation so that bad news travels fast Building a culture where bad news travels fast makes it safe to blamelessly raise problems and rapidly assemble the SWAT team to solve those problems. As the team on the front lines of most customer problems, delivery teams need practiced norms around blameless escalation within and across teams. 3 of my favorite tactics here: Red alerts — The tactic is a redalert email listserv that flags for widespread visibility any high-risk, urgent problems (product bug, churn risk, delivery delay). While the widespread visibility shouldn’t change the ownership of getting to a quick resolution, it allowed us to more effectively mobilize a cross-functional response when needed. We had a culture where anyone could start a red alert without blame, and instigators of red alerts were publicly thanked (and conversely, I would be unhappy if I learned about a problem from a customer instead of a red alert). Retrospectives — simple debriefs after any project: what went well, what didn’t go well, what will we do differently next time, shared to the full business. Customer aliases (See above). Lesson 10: Obsess over automation and expanding leverage for this team. Building leverage is a consistent theme across the above principles — it’s part of the ROI of hiring ‘overqualified’ talent who automate their job, key to the three-part Delivery charter, the way to maintain high-margin ratios, and an avenue to product improvement. I think this will be one of the most immediate areas where AI has real impact on companies: over the next few years, many tasks that Delivery Teams currently perform will become highly automated, especially non-relational tasks such as data preparation, data integration, and system configuration. For instance, building API integrations — an essential part of implementing enterprise SaaS products — is already being automated (see Fractional AI’s is work with Airbyte ). Obsessing about automation has always been important for delivery teams, but it’s especially important now. — And of course… different companies at different stages have different needs. Using support@ may be a necessity for a B2B SaaS business serving SMBs. There have been select occasions where a product has reached a stage of maturity in its development where I’ve combined delivery and customer success teams. That said, for high-growth, enterprise SaaS businesses, this playbook is what I’ve seen work best time and again. Many thanks to Annie Powers, who worked with me to draft this article, as well as the many exceptional product implementation leads that I’ve co-developed this playbook with over time.","Thu, 20 Jun 2024 03:28:34 GMT"
Introducing Protege — Empowering data holders to safely license training data to AI developers,https://travismay.medium.com/introducing-protege-empowering-data-holders-to-safely-license-training-data-to-ai-developers-c27b34c00849?source=rss-519ecefb7852------2,"Introducing Protege — Empowering data holders to safely license training data to AI developers There are three foundational bottlenecks to developing AI: algorithms, computational power, and data. While the first two have robust markets around them, the process of obtaining data for training AI is currently a wild west — suboptimal for both owners of data/content as well as developers of AI. Shaper Capital is thrilled to launch Protege to address this, alongside Bobby Samuels , Richard Ho , Ray Shi , and Engy Ziedan . *** The process of getting the right data for training purposes currently ranges from arduous to impossible. Early-stage AI companies sometimes require millions of dollars and years negotiating access to the right dataset; larger LLM companies are seeking every piece of rich data they can find and often missing proprietary data sets. Meanwhile, data providers (ranging from Reddit to textbook companies to hospital systems) want to license data but don’t know where to start and are rightly concerned about the privacy, security, and IP implications of letting companies build models on top of their data. So data remains illiquid, even though there are eager buyers and sellers. This isn’t the right industrial organization. The market needs a platform to connect data buyers and sellers in a way that puts control into the hands of data sources and helps them manage the privacy, security, and downstream usage of data. This would jumpstart the AI economy, opening up new opportunities that previously weren’t possible and dramatically lowering the cost (both in dollars and time) in building AI. The winners will be both the data buyers building the models and the data holders too. To solve this problem, I’m excited to announce Protege. Protege will be the data layer helping to unlock private training data sets for AI. We believe this layer will be a critical part of the AI stack. Every organization building an AI application or foundational model needs to look externally for data. This problem is not specific to any one industry. From healthcare to agriculture to marketing to finance, similar dynamics exist. The solution needed should span all industries. A core part of Protege’s ethos is a belief in source-centricity. Data sources have deep concerns about their data being misused by AI models, ranging from privacy & security violations to unauthorized use of their IP by derivative models. We see our role as ensuring sources have complete control of their data and have confidence in the safety of how it’s used. And we began with a privacy and security review before we wrote a single line of code. AI today is where the internet was in 1995 , and we expect orders of magnitudes of growth in the coming years and decades. A data layer will be one of the critical parts of the infrastructure for the coming boom, and the winner will be a massive, incredibly impactful company. In the coming weeks, we will announce our first vertical and will rapidly scale to more verticals shortly after. In the meantime, we are hiring engineers, superstar generalists, and GM’s for new verticals. We’d love to hear from you if it sounds like a fit at withprotege.ai/careers .","Fri, 31 May 2024 01:01:20 GMT"
Startup Mafias,https://travismay.medium.com/startup-mafias-83e76a783b39?source=rss-519ecefb7852------2,"Today marks the 10th anniversary of Acxiom acquiring LiveRamp. In retrospect, while there’s so much of the journey I remember fondly , the part of the journey I’m most proud of is the incredible alumni network: today, there’s still a tight network of ex-LiveRampers building thriving businesses. More than half of the first 40 employees are CEOs of startups or executives at larger companies. Included in the LiveRamp alumni are founders, CEOs, and key executives of a collective ~$25 billion of market cap: Airbyte (founder/CEO), Above Data (founder/CEO), Arbital Health (CCO), Cloudinary (CCO), Cred (founder/CEO), Datavant (founder/fmr CEO), Deduce (founder/CEO), Demandbase (CFO), Estuary (founder/CEO), Fabius (founder/CEO), Facet Wealth (founder/CEO), Fermat (founder/ceo), Fractional AI (founders/ceo & cto), Guild (CFO), Integral (founder/CEO), Magic Patterns (founder/CEO), Medallion (CTO), Nielsen (CFO), Olo (CCO), Orchid (CTO), Peerwell (founder/CEO), Portable (founder/CEO), Rippling (GC), Rubrik (Chief Product Officer), Safegraph (founder/CEO), Shaper Capital (founder/CEO), Superhuman (co-founder), Ternary (founder/ceo), TravelJoy (founder/CEO & cto), Windfall Data (founder/COO), Zapier (Chief People Officer), and Zendrive (founder/ceo). [And let me know who I missed!] And — even a decade later — there are still several execs in key roles at LiveRamp who joined in the early days. Five years ago, Auren Hoffman wrote a post about startup alumni networks and his hypothesis on why LiveRamp’s Mafia has been successful. Like PayPal, his view was that great startup mafias come when: “(1) the company had a successful outcome but not crazy successful; (2) the company went through a bunch of trying times (and almost went out of business); and (3) the employees built a company that was super enduring and even prospered post-exit.” I think this is definitely true for LiveRamp. A few other factors that I think have driven the success: Extremely high talent density. We hired generalist talent really well across teams — and the median employee was extremely talented. So it’s not shocking from this perspective that they have been successful since. Extremely high entrepreneurial density. One of the traits we hired for was ability to handle ambiguity, and being a general self-starter. Again, not shocking that this team has been successful since. Opportunities for massive personal growth within the company. Many employees had exponential moments of personal growth within LiveRamp, because i) LiveRamp grew exponentially and ii) it biased towards promoting from within. So many people learned to take on stretch positions and skyrocketed in the responsibility they could handle. A tight-knit community. Many LiveRamp alumni are still in close touch and many close friendships were forged within the company — which has helped build a strong network where there is a lot of co-investment, joint brainstorming, and teaming up that happens between former LiveRampers. No massive talent exodus post-exit. Many great people from the early days are still at LiveRamp, and departures happened very gradually over the last decade. That means that when people ultimately left, they left for a great opportunity — rather than a moment where they felt they needed to leave. It turns out that many of the traits that made LiveRamp a great company have also made it a great alumni network. It’s amazing to see what this team has accomplished in the last decade, and I can’t wait to see what happens in the decade ahead. LiveRamp’s office in 667 Mission St., circa 2014. Update: And Auren Hoffman just wrote a great reflection today on lessons from LiveRamp, here .","Tue, 14 May 2024 04:25:43 GMT"
Introducing Fractional AI,https://travismay.medium.com/introducing-fractional-ai-3200c35db399?source=rss-519ecefb7852------2,"I am thrilled to announce the launch of Fractional AI , led by Chris Taylor and Eddie Siegel (two superstars who I worked with at LiveRamp). Fractional AI is an elite dev shop focused on enterprise applications of generative AI. We believe that many of the biggest benefits of generative AI will come from automating workflows at large companies; we expect trillions of dollars of value will be created in the economy over the next decade by increasing automation and giving talented employees more leverage. But the companies with the biggest automation opportunities often are not designed to hire the talent needed to accomplish this. Our goal is to bridge this gap — and ensure that elite engineering talent is deployed to the highest-impact automation opportunities. This post walks through our founding thesis of Fractional AI, and why we believe this is such a valuable opportunity. *** A decade from now, we believe large incumbents will be 2–10x more productive per capita — primarily by automating existing workflows. There are now thousands of AI startups in Silicon Valley, many of which are chasing after becoming the next AI product company. While some new products will emerge, we believe that the most revolutionary impact of generative AI for enterprises will be helping to automate existing workflows for incumbents. These incumbents are the companies with strong market positions and long-standing problems measured in billions of dollars that were unsolvable before the rise of AI. Even modest enhancements in productivity or automation can result in huge value creation when multiplied by their large scale. And unlike other technology shifts, AI is uniquely suited for automating workflows — everything from improving call center operations to medical billing to customer service has a realistic path to automation. And these companies are keenly aware of this — C-level executives and board members at every company of consequence are thinking hard about this AI-led wave of disruption as both an enormous opportunity and an existential threat. The challenges for incumbents to take advantage of generative AI are real. So why haven’t these companies adopted GenAI in a meaningful way? We could cite Gartner reports all day; 79% of corporate strategists see AI as critical to their success over the next 2 years, yet only 20% report using AI. Worse yet, only 10% of enterprises used AI in production in 2023. And this isn’t a simple case of large companies moving slowly — conversations with leaders at small, fast moving tech companies tell a similar story. Everybody has ideas for high impact AI projects, but very few projects have made it past the starting line. If you zoom in on the ways that these companies have actually adopted AI, it’s usually not the transformative, billion-dollar overhauls you see. They’re starting with low-hanging fruit — using ChatGPT internally, making simple OpenAI API calls, or maybe attempting a PoC of some internally-facing RAG applications. But the truly seismic opportunities, like embedding custom models deep into customer interactions or overhauling call centers, remain largely untapped. These are complicated: they are often risky projects with high uncertainty and cost, they don’t have natural owners or budgets and span multiple parts of organizations, and they require bespoke solutions that aren’t readily served by the market. But we believe that the biggest challenge is a talent bottleneck. The biggest bottleneck is talent. Few of the largest enterprises have focused on hiring the “best of the best” for engineering talent. Most of the time, this talent is expensive and difficult to hire at scale, and great engineers are motivated by engineering-centric cultures, high talent density, interesting technical challenges, and high compensation. While many tech startups focus on recruiting this kind of talent, the needs of a large enterprise simply don’t warrant specializing in this type of hiring. But this moment is different: to really take advantage of AI for automation, you need elite engineers. The best engineers will be on the forefront of AI best practices when they exist, and will be able to succeed in the face of uncertainty when they do not. For those uncertain projects where a clever approach is the difference between success and failure, great engineering is a crucial ingredient. So large enterprises are simultaneously the best positioned to reap the productivity benefits of AI, and poorly suited to hire the talent needed to accomplish this. Fractional AI Fractional AI exists to bridge this gap. We’re building a world-class engineering team that is focused on unlocking massive value using AI. We do what the big companies can’t by building an in-person team in San Francisco and fostering the culture that attracts and retains highly skilled engineers. We challenge them with meaningful work, invest in their growth, pay them well, and surround them with impressive people. We’re building the kind of startup culture that makes the best engineers actually want to come to work every day. Our mission is to inspire an elite team of engineers to solve the world’s most valuable problems using AI Our model This high caliber team works hand-in-glove with the world’s most consequential companies to solve their most valuable problems with the help of AI. Companies hire us for a blend of consulting and hands-on software creation, tailored to each client’s unique needs. This services-oriented business model has a number of advantages for our clients: It enables us to embrace the bespoke nature of these challenging AI problems; rather than building a product that solves 80% of a need for many companies, we can focus on getting all the way to 100% for a single client. It lets us see how real-world problems are solved with AI across many companies, which gives us the vantage point needed to be on the cutting edge of best practices. For risky projects with uncertain outcomes, we can share in the risk and share in the upside. It will align incentives and help our clients keep costs down for projects that don’t pan out, paying more only when massive value is unlocked. Another thing we love about this vantage point is how success feeds our ability to invest in our employees: Being on the cutting edge makes for a great learning opportunity. Employees can join with strong engineering skills but limited AI experience and leave as AI trailblazers. We have a unique opportunity to experience a best-of-all-worlds work environment: large, impactful, interesting projects with recognizable brands, but an exciting, fast-paced startup culture. By seeing valuable projects across many companies, we’re well positioned to spot patterns. When clients experience common pain points that can be alleviated by products that don’t exist yet, we can invest in creating them. Many of our best team members will have an entrepreneurial nature, and this will give us pathways to feed that in the form of side bets, spinoffs, and joint ventures with our clients. While these two elements of our model feed each other, they also represent separate and distinct commitments. Our dedication to our clients and our team are both first-class attributes of the company, and neither takes precedence over the other.","Thu, 04 Apr 2024 20:12:08 GMT"
Company-Building during the AI Wave,https://travismay.medium.com/company-building-during-the-ai-wave-f43102a17032?source=rss-519ecefb7852------2,"For anyone starting a company in 2024, there are new questions to grapple with, such as “How is AI going to change this industry,” “are we in an AI bubble,” “are incumbents going to win with AI or are new startups going to win,” and “is AI for X a good startup idea even though dozens of other companies are going after the same goal?” This post walks through the principles I’ve used when considering AI opportunities to bet on. 1. Act like it’s 1995. I’ve generally been a skeptic of hyped industries (eg. crypto, web3, etc.). AI is the first hype wave that I’ve become a true believer in. Even as a true believer, I don’t believe that the most extreme outcomes are likely. Instead of AI putting humans out of work, my bet is more modest: I would bet on a 2–5x surge in American productivity over the next decade. While this is a much smaller outcome than many AI advocates believe is likely, this would be a massive change for the US economy and society — and an even bigger outcome than the .com boom. Based on this assumption, I look at the world like it’s 1995 for the .com boom — we are very early in a massive transformation in the economy, and while there is some froth and some ups and downs that will come in the coming years, fundamentally there is about to be an explosion in value for AI innovation. As a result, I believe that: This is a moment to be long on everything. It’s part of why I embarked on Shaper and think it makes sense to start lots of companies simultaneously. This is the best time ever to start a new company. There is a massive amount of innovation about to take place, and value to be captured by innovators. 2. Fundamentals matter, and companies need to find defensibility. Many companies are being started with the view of “X is possible, and if I do X, it will revolutionize an industry.” Even in cases where that may be true, it doesn’t necessarily result in a good startup idea; the fundamentals of “will this be a good business at steady state” still need to be true. In particular, in the race to execute on exciting opportunities with AI, it seems like many companies aren’t asking themselves whether their business is defensible; in the long-term, these companies will not thrive, even if they were the first to bring AI into X industry. Being a first-mover can be valuable if it’s a means to an end to create a defensible moat, but economic returns will ultimately accrue to the portion of the value chain that creates differentiated value and has few substitutes. As a corollary — the advantages that large incumbents in many industries have (clear moats, distribution networks, etc.) will continue to be advantages in a post-AI world, and large incumbents that are clever about utilizing AI will emerge stronger than ever. 3. Beware Silicon Valley dogma that is no longer applicable. While fundamentals matter that are based on first principles, there are many pieces of startup dogma that I think are not necessarily true in the AI era. For example, I think the “product” vs. “services” distinction is not especially relevant, and is not based on first principles. Margin certainly matters, and scalability certainly matters — which has historically been correlated with being a “product” business. But in the era of AI, there will be high-margin, highly-scalable “services” businesses as well. Similarly, optimizing for “recurring revenue” in SAAS is overly dogmatic. Having strong long-term value from customers with minimal customer acquisition costs is a relevant goal from first principles, but recurring revenue isn’t the only way to get there; Google, Facebook, Apple, and Amazon don’t have recurring revenue models today on their core businesses. I’d predict that many top companies innovate on pricing as well. 4. Opportunity abounds in the complements The AI wave won’t only benefit “AI companies;” it will also benefit complementary technologies and businesses. For example, the area I’m most focused on is data. While data itself doesn’t change with AI, I predict the value of certain data sets to skyrocket based on the AI wave, because it is so valuable to AI companies. I’d predict that many of the most valuable businesses created by the AI wave won’t be directly related to AI, but rather are complementary to AI. 5. Figuring out product market fit will be hard. One of Datavant’s board members always asked the same valuable question in 100% of board meetings: “What percentage of your customers are getting fundamental value from you, and what percentage use you in their ‘innovation showcase’?” This was always an extremely useful question. The reality is, large entreprises spend money on technology that creates value for them, but they also spend money on “innovation projects” that are ultimately proofs of concepts or vanity projects. True product-market fit is based on creating fundamental value for customers. During a major boom, lots of money is spent on “innovation showcase” projects — and it’s possible to get a large amount of revenue without having true product-market fit. Differentiating “revenue growth” from “product-market fit” will be complex for entrepreneurs, but large economic outcomes will only come from companies that get true product-market fit. 6. Blitzscaling will make a comeback in some areas. In the 2010s, blitzscaling was popular as a strategy, and often made sense as a strategy: because interest rates were low, spending capital today for growth tomorrow made sense. There were many companies that took this too far, and threw money away wastefully. By 2022, this became frowned upon, and companies had a wave of belt-tightening as interest rates went up. Even with higher interest rates, the strategy of blitzscaling still fundamentally makes sense in many AI businesses: in a moment of rapid technical change and large prizes for moving rapidly, going into “land grab” mode makes sense as a strategy. Companies will need to ask themselves how quickly an industry will change, how much first-mover advantage matters, and what the prize is at the end (eg. is there defensibility at steady-state). As a result, there will be more companies in 2024 that pursue a blitzscaling strategy, and losing money in the near-term can be a viable strategy. (Hopefully, this doesn’t become synonymous with “wasteful spending” again— but there will be companies that take this too far) 7. Talent will be the bottleneck As industries change quickly with AI, many companies will win by being nimble and quickest to capitalize on market changes. The biggest lever in corporate nimbleness/velocity is talent, and great talent will become even more valuable. While “AI talent” is at a premium today, much of the value will actually come from generalist talent. Strong generalist engineers who can figure out how to incorporate AI into technical workflows will become increasingly valuable. Strong generalist managers who can figure out how to navigate a rapidly-changing industry will become increasingly valuable. Companies that have access to the best generalist talent will disproportionately move faster, and disproportionately win. While this has always been true, I believe that the AI wave will amplify this effect.","Wed, 03 Apr 2024 04:30:06 GMT"
A Playbook for Building a B2B Network Business,https://travismay.medium.com/a-playbook-for-building-a-b2b-network-business-90964781a516?source=rss-519ecefb7852------2,"For both LiveRamp and Datavant, a key factor in our success was internally viewing the businesses as a “network” from day 1, and methodically following a network playbook. From VISA to telecom companies to cable companies, many of the largest companies ever built are networks. These businesses have literal “network effects,” because their value to customers increases as their network expands. VISA is incredibly convenient for consumers because it is widely adopted by merchants, and it is critical for merchants because so many consumers have a VISA card. Network density becomes the killer feature for network businesses. The playbook for building a network business is subtly different from businesses with other strategies. “Escape velocity” and “minimum viable network” become core concepts in company building, as getting to critical mass as quickly as possible becomes existential. Most B2B companies are not network businesses, so many of the playbooks and pattern matching by investors and experienced executives don’t perfectly apply to network businesses. Below are some of the approaches I’ve found helpful in building out network businesses. Tactic 1: Have Clear Network KPIs — nodes & edges A simple step of building a network business is to rally the company around network metrics. Without explicit network KPIs, revenue and other metrics will domniate as the focus of a company, which are generally imperfectly correlated with network expansion. A lack of metrics also leads to lots of internal arguments over whether strategy A or B is right for the network, without a clear optimization function for resolving debates. At Datavant, in the early days, we had two metrics that we tracked relentlessly (as closely as we tracked revenue): nodes of the network (what we called “installed sites”) , and edges in the network (what we called “links”): A node was a company that was using Datavant technology; once they used us once, it was very easy for others in the network to do business with that company in the future. Edges were unique relationships between different parties in the network; if company A sourced data from company B and company C, that would be 2 edges. This was a rough metric of network throughput. Establishing these metrics and prioritizing them relentlessly made many other aspects of our strategy clear, as you’ll see below. Tactic 2: Look for subnetworks to get density Generally, what we think of as a “network” actually consists of lots of subnetworks, each of which have their own internal network effects and where it is easier to get to critical mass network density. For example, Facebook was built by being a social network at Harvard, then a social network at Ivy League schools, then a social network at all colleges, then a social network for everyone. This meant that at the early colleges, Facebook had critical mass density, well before it had critical mass everywhere. Had they tried to launch everywhere initially, even if they had the same initial number of users, they would not have had critical mass density anywhere — and would have failed to get traction. For Datavant, we found that the ecosystem around commercial claims data was a subtly different ecosystem than the ecosystem around oncology data, which was subtly different than the ecosystem around public sector, and subtly different than clinical trials; all of these networks needed to be connected in the long-term, but we could get to “critical mass density” more quickly by focusing on specific areas. So we methodically focused on different submarkets where critical mass density was feasible. Tactic 3: Go narrow on features. Common advice is to go after a product with a large total addressable market; I think that this is perhaps the worst advice that VCs frequently give to entrepreneurs. In reality, while it is good to build sequentially into a larger and larger TAM, you want to go after the smallest viable TAM to get there: narrow products are much easier to crack a network effect. You want to go narrow on two dimensions: Size of network. In the Facebook example, it’s easier to build “the social network for Harvard students” than the “social network for everybody” precisely because it’s a smaller market. Size of feature set. You ideally want to have the minimum viable number of features in the early days. In a true network business, each individual feature has its own chicken-and-egg network effect (eg. “phone calls” and “texting” both require critical mass adoption, even though they’re on the same network), so you want to avoid fighting for critical mass adoption on multiple fronts simultaneously. Additionally, because ubiquity is so important, you’ll want large incumbents to rely on you as a channel partner (more on that below), and so reducing your feature set decreases your level of competitive threat — letting you more quickly get network scale. Tactic 4: Cultivate network-referred sales In Datavant’s early days, one of the most amazing features of the business was that ~90% of new business was customer-referred — meaning our best marketing channel (by far) was existing customers. This is true in a lot of network businesses: your power customers get value from your network expanding, and so — if you align closely with them — they refer lots of additional customers your way. To make this work, obviously it was important that our product added enough value for us to be referred frequently, but it was also critical for us to make the sales reps at the partner want to bring us into conversations . This involved us obsessing with being perceived as quick & easy to work with, willingness to not take too much of the pie, and having sales reps who could deftly handle three-way conversations. Tactic 5: Look for supernodes When most companies think about their wishlist of perfect customers, they think about who can drive the most revenue potential. In a network business, the perfect customer instead maximizes the network throughput (which is imperfectly correlated with revenue). For Datavant, a counter-intuitive part of our initial strategy was focusing our sales on the ecosystem of analytics companies servicing pharma, instead of servicing pharma companies directly. Almost every VC we spoke with had the view “all the money is in pharma; you should focus on them;” all of our competitors went in this direction. Instead, our view was that analytics companies are power users of data and drive more network activity than pharma, and have faster sales cycles — so it’s the faster path to network ubiquity. We especially doubled down on the handful of customers that became “supernodes;” at our peak, our 5 biggest customers were driving ~25% of our network activity. Even if they weren’t giant from a revenue perspective, this drove our network to take off. Tactic 6: Become channel agnostic If the primary goal is to get as much network throughput as quickly as possible, a useful accelerant is channel partnerships. The main downside of channel partnerships (assuming you can successfully set them up — they are tricky to operationalize) is that you lose the relationship with the end customer, and ultimately capture less value per customer. In a network business, these are generally very reasonable tradeoffs for accelerating your footprint more quickly. At LiveRamp, when we were $30 mm ARR, ~80% of our revenue came from 5 channel partners; we only started going direct when we were much larger. While this was an unusual path, channel relationships shaved several years off of our path to becoming perceived as the universal standard in the industry and getting to escape velocity. Tactic 7: Short-term success = Long-term success In every business, the CEO has a complex job of balancing short-term goals (hit the number this quarter) with long-term goals (eg. build the product successfully). In a network business, I think short-term goals and long-term goals are extremely correlated: your long-term success is determined more than anything else by hitting network escape velocity. Being successful in the short-term is the most important determinant of long-term success because it unlocks more network density, which in turn makes your product more compelling. Short-term momentum also creates a sense of inevitability in the market and swagger within your team, which becomes self-fulfilling. So I generally am “short-termist” in goals, looking for accelerants for how we maximize our success this quarter/month/week — not because I don’t care about the long-term, but precisely because I believe short-term success is the biggest driver of long-term success, and escape velocity is everything. Tactic 8: Make it a no-brainer to work with you. As you establish network ubiquity, customers are making bets on whether they want to be in your network — and you want the answer to be an obvious yes. This means you need to be relentless about being low-friction to work with, and never lose deals on price or extraneous contract terms. Remember, nodes are valuable — even if they don’t pay you anything. That doesn’t mean you should make your product free by default (that rarely works as a strategy to increase adoption), but it does mean you should have a mechanism to discount aggressively when needed, and make the standard on the sales team to never lose a deal to competition on price. Similarly, you want to be seen as easy to work with — quick to turnaround contracts, great support, and a general culture of excellence + velocity . Make the choice to partner with you as much of a no-brainer as possible. Tactic 9: Look for step functions on network expansion The vast majority of growth for network businesses should come from a relentless grind for more and more nodes and edges one at a time. Beyond pushing this grind forward, part of the CEO’s job is also to find the step functions. Some step functions are more complex partnerships — setting up the right channel partnerships, or finding the incumbents who can help “king-make” your network. In the early days of VISA, they spent several years obsessing over their relationships with banks as their most critical partners. Network businesses also lend themselves to more early-stage M&A than other business models. The most straightforward M&A hypotheses are usually finding complimentary subnetworks, and are along the lines of “we are the leading railroad of the east; you are the leading railroad of the west; we can combine and become the leading railroad in the country.” When that’s actually true and expands the network dramatically, 1+1 can equal 5 in combining the networks. Tactic 10: Make ubiquity part of the brand The killer feature of most network businesses is the fact that they are ubiquitous; phones are great because everyone has a phone, and VISA cards are great because they’re accepted everywhere. All the other features are secondary. As you build your company brand, it’s helpful to make ubiquity an explicit part of the brand. Just like VISA is “everywhere you want to be,” you want to be perceived as ubiquitous. This can be done with how you describe your company, the sense of momentum that you create for your company, the conferences you host, the advisors you engage, etc. — but you want to ensure that there is a sense of inevitability around you. Before you have established a massive network, your customers are making decisions to bet on you; if they believe that you will be ubiquitous, that’s an easier bet to make. So building the sense of inevitability becomes self-fulfilling. Tactic 11: Look for ways to eliminate network effects in the early days Once you’ve established a minimum viable network, network effects are an amazing feature of a business model by creating a strong moat and driving customer-referred sales. Until you reach that point, network effects can work against you. Why would anybody join a network that doesn’t have critical mass? One hack around this is to look for “single player mode” approaches . In this analogy, multi-player video games are games that have network effects; they require enough other players to want to play simultaneously. An effective way for games to get to that point is to have a great “single-player mode” — where people play against the computer directly, so the product is valuable whether or not there’s a network already playing. In other words, if it’s possible to eliminate the network effects to start, that can be an effective way to bypass the chicken-and-egg problem until you have a critical mass of customers. At Datavant, the use cases we serviced initially were around connecting internal data sets (which did not require a network), before we had the critical mass to also connect external data sets . *** A visualization of how network effects scale, thanks to Wikipedia. These tactics all exist as a means to reach network escape velocity. For a network business, network density and throughput is everything, and escape velocity is the moment where the density goes from holding you back until the network effect begins to work in your favor.","Thu, 25 Jan 2024 03:37:01 GMT"
Building the Right Operating Cadence,https://travismay.medium.com/building-the-right-operating-cadence-6c608fd142e1?source=rss-519ecefb7852------2,"This article is a playbook for CEOs on what rituals, meetings, and processes to introduce at each stage of a high-growth tech company’s journey. *** A common theme of my posts is that operating velocity is one of the most important determinants of success for a business. Operating velocity helps you create an exceptional culture and phenomenal team, both of which are critical ingredients to moving even faster. There is one other ingredient that makes or breaks the velocity of a company: its operating cadence. By the time you cross 10 employees, as CEO, you start to ritualize key team events. Events like the “Weekly All-Hands” become a standard way that communication occurs and culture is built. As you get bigger, these events are the “operating cadence” of a company — they are the rhythm of an organization that shape how decisions get made and how information is shared as companies scale. Different companies have different operating cadences: some companies are meeting-heavy, and some underemphasize communication; some companies develop process too early, and others too late. As companies cross a few hundred employees, almost all communication and decision-making needs to work its way into the operating cadence. Great CEOs build their operating cadences with intentionality, thinking about what communications are critical to whom and the best forums for the communication to take place. A few principles in process design are important here: Unless you are a nuclear power plant, 95% of your operating cadence should be “positive process” (process that accelerates the team by reducing steps required for coordination) over “negative process” (process that is designed as a checkpoint to prevent mistakes) Bias towards centralized process when there’s complex cross-team coordination, and against centralized process otherwise. Design your organization to minimize these scenarios. Require the minimum viable number of people in meetings to make processes effective (and encourage people to not come if the process isn’t helpful) To avoid meeting creep, eliminate processes with meetings unless the benefit is very crisp Give people access to the information they need to run their parts of the business — use emails, team meetings, etc. to curate and distribute information transparently This post walks through the key rituals that were part of the Datavant & LiveRamp operating cadence at scale (>500 employees), and then outlines what stage we added each ritual. While each subteam had its own rituals, these were the ones that made it onto my radar as key events. *** Team-Wide Communication: Weekly Team Meetings. Starting when the companies were 5 employees, we set up a weekly 30-minute meeting to touch base on “what’s going on in the company” — and scaled this as we grew. We scheduled these for Monday mornings, and we had ~2 minute updates from each major function leader, as well as 1–2 “ spotlight topics” (selected by me or my Chief of Staff to curate what was important) per week. Win Celebrations. Rituals to celebrate company wins are extremely helpful — they focus the organization on key outcomes, and also create a morale boost with momentum. Up to 100 people, we had “Gong Time,” where every time a key deal was closed or major win happened, someone would ring a gong…and every few days we’d gather round the gong for people to talk about their wins. We also encouraged “Deal Won” emails — where the sales rep would email the whole team would outline a deal that just closed, and context on the customer’s use case. From there, the rest of the team would respond with congratulations. The last day of the quarter was especially fun! Quarterly Company, Team, and Individual OKRs. On the first day of the quarter, I would send the full company objectives & key results for the quarter; we would then have a “quarterly kickoff” meeting within the first week where we’d review the outcomes from the last quarter and discuss the goals for the next quarter. I generally locked on these with the management team a week ahead of time, and then team leaders would send out the teams’ goals (for teams where OKRs were the right format). And we would publicly set individual OKRs as well within the first week — so everyone could see each others’ goals and focus areas. Quarterly All-Stakeholder Emails. On the first day of each quarter, I sent a ~3 page recap of the last quarter to all of the company’s shareholders, as well as the team and all of our advisors. A well-written recap helps to make it clear how individual accomplishments connect to the big picture, and reiterate the big picture. Sharing financials. I shared all of our board decks with the team (including full financials except specific compensation information), and our monthly financial flash reports, along with some curation/explanation by the finance team. Weekly Digest. Once we crossed ~200 people, we began sending “weekly digests” — with key announcements and big wins. These were typically owned by a Chief of Staff with some input by me, ensuring that the most important themes are consistently highlighted. Lunch & Learns. Starting around 20 employees, we had weekly “lunch & learns” — optional meetings where a team member would walk through some topic relevant to the business. From guest presentations by clients to an overview of our cap table to a deep dive on policy changes impacting our business, these were usually interesting — and provided an outlet for optional, structured content. Bi-annual offsite. If part/all of the team is remote, it’s critical to get people together on some frequency. Up to 500 people, we made this a camping trip. Sunday Thoughts . Every Sunday, I would email the team an email on whatever was top-of-mind for me (often about our strategy, or a customer use case I was excited about, or something I was concerned about, etc.) Retrospectives. Starting at just a few employees, we had a robust culture of retrospectives. Whenever a major event happened (especially one where we made mistakes), the team involved would write a retrospective of what we learned and publish it to the whole company. This helped normalize mistakes happening and learning from them without having a culture of blame. Leadership Team Coordination: Weekly Management Meetings. Once you cross 30 employees, you need some form of regular cadence of meetings with a management team. I hosted these meetings weekly for 45–60 minutes and ran the agenda as a “communication/alignment meeting” rather than a “decision meeting” — decisions were made by the right subgroups offline. Weekly Outcomes Tracker. One of the best micro-hacks I’ve found for communication is the weekly status tracker. Each week, by Sunday evening, every member of the management team would fill out a shared Google Sheet with three columns next to each executive’s name: “Top 3 priorities for next week”, “Up to 3 positive outcomes from last week”, “Up to 3 negative outcomes from last week.” Everyone was expected to read this document ahead of our management meeting and ask questions of each other. Quarterly Leadership Offsites. Starting around 30 employees, we hosted a one-day offsite once a quarter for the management team (often in a conference room down the hall, but sometimes traveling if a critical mass of the team is remote). The goal was debate/discussion/alignment (NOT decision-making). We would pick 3–6 topics for the day (example: “is it time to do an international launch”), and give each topic an owner who would prepare a 1–3 page pre-read. Quarterly Board Meetings. As soon as we had external capital, we began hosting quarterly 3-hour quarterly board meetings (as long as 2-days for public companies, but I think 3-hours is sufficient). In between board meetings, we hosted mid-quarter sales/financial updates (30–60 minutes). The most productive board meetings I’ve hosted had elaborate pre-read packages, where each executive gave a 1–2 page update on their function, and ~30 minutes was spent on Q&A with the board, followed by 2.5 hours of “spotlight” topics. Weekly 1:1’s. These are nobody’s favorite meetings…but I think they’re essential parts of a healthy operating cadence at any size. I let my direct reports set the agenda, and also have a “below the line” portion of the agenda with updates I should be aware of. Most skip-level 1:1’s were ad hoc. Monthly Business Reviews. Once we crossed 200 employees, I began spending a day each month in “business reviews” to systematically get updates and provide feedback on key initiatives across the business. Each month, I would ask 10–20 leaders of key initiatives to do monthly, 30-minute update sessions on their initiative. To make these sessions valuable, each meeting was capped with only 2–8 attendees, and there was a 1–2 page pre-read plus 1–2 “discussion topics” for the meeting. Customers & Sales: Deal Desk. As companies cross 100 employees, it can be frustrating for a sales person to get a deal done — depending on the deal, they may need legal signoff, finance sign-off, privacy sign-off, product sign-off, sales leadership signoff on pricing, etc. To make this fast (but ensure there’s adequate review by key stakeholders), we had a simple template that the sales rep would fill out and send to a “deal desk” email alias. Most deals would be approved on the same-day, but we had a standing “deal desk” meeting as a venue for escalation. Customer Aliases. For every customer, we created an email alias (eg. client123@datavant.com) that included all the people involved in supporting the account, as well as anyone in the company that wanted to track the account. Then, whenever we communicated with the client, we CC’d the alias, so lots of people internally could track what’s happening. This was great for quick information-sharing across delivery and sales teams, and also a helpful way for leadership to know the pulse of key accounts. At-Risk Reviews. Once you cross $20mm of ARR, it’s helpful to have a regularly-scheduled discussion of what accounts have churn risk associated with them. If something churns that is not on the list, that means you have an information problem. We held these monthly. Quarterly Sales Kick-off. The beginning of the quarter is a key moment for sales — and we used these kickoffs to discuss our path to hit the number, updates in the market, and updates in the product. Quarterly Partnership Reviews. Each quarter, we would try to have a check-in meeting with executive sponsors at almost all of our customers — even if there wasn’t an imminent upsell or churn event. Account Planning Brainstorms. Once there were more than 10 people on the sales team, it was helpful for the sales team to do deep dives with each other to know the details of key accounts. Key executives would join these and publicly brainstorm how we can grow our most important partners. Red Alerts. Whenever something bad was happening for an account (disappointed client, churn, etc.), we expected the account owner to email the “red alerts” alias. This went to a bunch of key leaders in the org, so there could be widespread visibility on the issue (and escalation or creating a war room if needed). Product & Engineering: Quarterly Roadmapping. The roadmapping process is the single most important source of decision-making in most tech companies; micro- and macro-decisions are locked on through this process. I have never seen a company that loves it’s roadmapping process; it’s either too granular or not detailed enough. If there are more than 30 engineers, I am a fan of a process that allows for prioritizing 1–4 “big bets” at an executive level, allocation of resources across pods at an executive level, and then decision-making on the long-tail of projects at the pod level. A great product leader is critical to be able to navigate the big picture discussion with the micro-allocations that are being made. Annual product vision. Every year, I think it’s important to refresh the 3–5 year product vision — and either reconfirm what you’re building towards, or update the vision. I usually make this a late December project with the Head of Product and then they present it to the company as part of the yearly kick-off. Quarterly hackathons. There are always lots of competing priorities that make it feel like you should cancel this quarter’s hackathon. You shouldn’t. Many of the best ideas in a company are born in hackathons, and they’re a critical outlet for the innovation of the team. These are even more important as the team grows beyond 100 people. Legal, Security, and Privacy: Deal desk. Outlined above…the deal desk was the key forum for ensuring there was legal/privacy visibility on all deals and an outlet to review, without unnecessarily delaying deals. Roadmapping. Roadmapping isn’t just for product! It’s helpful to have a moment where there can be meaningful debate about “invest in SOC-2 or HiTrust” or “tradeoffs between going deep on GDPR or CCPA expertise.” I encourage leaders of functions that touch lots of different constituencies to host quarterly roadmapping sessions to make some of these debates clear. HR: Hotspot Reviews. Once you cross 100 employees, there are always several “fires” going on within the organization. I use a monthly “hotspots” meeting to track these fires systematically. Ahead of these, the People team would put together a list of hotspots/fires in the organization (eg. ABC team is low-morale right now; X key performer is probably about to resign because of tension with person Y; etc.), and rank their urgency on a scale of 1–5. At scale, there are usually dozens of fires, and it’s helpful to flip through the list; we would then use the meeting to talk through 1–5 of the issues that are most important and most solvable. Offer Approval Process. Starting at ~5 employees, I think it’s important to systematically think about how offers are made and approved: ensuring that you’re defaulting to no, hiring for strengths rather than lack of weaknesses, and have a high bar across the team. More on this process here . 9-Box Reviews. Firing people is one of the hardest things in business, and as a result, every company biases too much towards keeping low-performers. One approach to correcting this bias is a formalized 9-box review , where managers need to categorize their team as High/Medium/Low performance, and High/Medium/Low potential. With good discipline around forcing distributions, you then have visibility and a framework to encourage managers to part ways with low performers. Leveling & Compensation Reviews. As you cross 50 people, having “levels” for compensation becomes a helpful guide for the appropriate/default salary and equity of a new hire. I believe managers should be empowered to give raises ad hoc, but there should also be an annual process of confirming cross-team fairness. Pulse Survey. Once you cross 200 people, it becomes important to have a quantitative view of the mood of the company, broken down by team. We used quarterly, short (<10 question, custom designed as questions we cared about) surveys. Annual Performance Reviews. While micro-feedback should be given every day/week/month, meaningful, curated feedback about how employees can grow is important to do at least once per year. New hire onboarding. Starting around 20 employees, we were extremely focused on having a great new hire onboarding program — and making sure people walk out of their first week able to clearly articulate the vision, strategy, priorities, and culture — and know how to get things done internally. I met with every new hire cohort at the end of orientation to reinforce our culture and promote accessibility of leadership. Financial: Annual Budgeting Cycle. Once you have multiple employees, you need some form of budget, and once your revenue or burn exceeds $5 mm., it makes sense to start formalizing a budget process. At <$20 mm of revenue, this should be very lightweight. Monthly & Quarterly Financial Results. Having quick, clear visibility on the financial metrics becomes critical as you cross around $10 mm. ARR and can no longer keep all the numbers in your head. I like to share these results with the whole organization. Quarterly Forecasting. Once you cross $50 mm. in revenue (and especially if you are a public company), ongoing forecasts become critical. These are important to keep lightweight, but are helpful as leading financial indicators. *** When to introduce process As you can see above, there are dozens of processes that exist to be able to systematically have good communications and decision-making at scale. In an early stage, a lot of this is overkill. There is an art to introducing a process when it’s constructive, but not too early and not too late. This is my rough strawman for some of the processes above. And of course…there is also an art to killing processes that aren’t adding value (and making sure the processes are meaningfully time consuming, don’t have too large of meetings, etc.). Every company should look different. In the end, a good operating cadence is designed to help a company with a good culture and good talent to be high velocity.","Wed, 13 Dec 2023 03:03:03 GMT"
Introducing Arbital Health — A Neutral Umpire for Outcome-Based Contracts,https://travismay.medium.com/introducing-arbital-health-a-neutral-umpire-for-outcome-based-contracts-ee69655426c5?source=rss-519ecefb7852------2,"Introducing Arbital Health — A Neutral Umpire for Outcome-Based Contracts I’m thrilled to announce Arbital Health , one of the first companies incubated at Shaper Capital , partnering with Brian Overstreet as CEO. In the coming weeks, we will be sharing more about the incredible team coming together and some of our early moves to make this vision a reality. Below is an overview of our vision. We aim to solve one of the most fundamental problems in healthcare — and in turn help unlock a health system with better outcomes, better value, and better experiences for patients. **** The biggest problem in healthcare is misaligned incentives. The healthcare system suffers from low quality, poor experience, high cost, and poor outcomes. The fundamental reason for this is a market failure due to misaligned incentives. Organizations that deliver care and therapy manufacturers have vastly different incentives than organizations that pay for care, who in turn have vastly different incentives than patients. The thousands of middlemen throughout the system only add to the problem. Most other issues in healthcare are downstream of this fundamental problem. To align incentives, we should move away from fee-for-service pricing towards paying for value. Most healthcare today is provided in a fee-for-service model — the more services delivered, the more you pay. Instead, healthcare should be paid for based on the outcomes delivered. The cost for a drug like Ozempic should be based on weight loss or reduction of diabetes and cardiovascular events, not another high fixed prescription fee. Providers that invest in their patients to prevent chronic disease should be rewarded, not stymied by a system that incentivizes more treatment and quick fixes. A value-based care system can align all parties toward an outcomes-based set of incentives. But there is a challenge: how do you measure value in care? “Value” is subjective. Even for objective outcomes, the counterparties in a value-based transaction struggle today to reconcile contracts. Data is fragmented, trust is low, analytics are sparse, and incentives remain misaligned. The process of reconciling an outcome-based contract can take several quarters, and can turn into a major renegotiation when the two sides disagree on metrics. We are launching Arbital Health to be a neutral umpire of outcome-based contracts. We will focus on earning the industry’s trust as a neutral and accurate third party. We will make it easy to design, measure, and adjudicate outcome-based contracts. In 10 years, we aspire to be the trusted umpire adjudicating every outcome-based contract in healthcare, whether contracts are between life sciences companies and payers, payers and providers, or employers and digital health companies. By creating Arbital Health, we believe that we will resolve one of the biggest roadblocks to the wide adoption of value-based care. We will make it simple to adjudicate contracts and unlock the trillion-dollar shift to value-based care in America. In doing so, we will help to solve healthcare’s biggest problem. *** Does this sound exciting? Join our team at careers@arbitalhealth.com .","Tue, 28 Nov 2023 16:26:35 GMT"
12 Principles on Building & Scaling Company Culture,https://travismay.medium.com/12-principles-on-building-scaling-company-culture-5e0d461c4275?source=rss-519ecefb7852------2,"Building LiveRamp and Datavant, the single thing I’m most proud of is the culture at the companies. Veterans of both businesses describe it as the most special moments of their career, the industry has viewed us as great to work with (or alternatively, viewed us as a cult), both companies thrived on Glassdoor and other metrics, and I was personally known for being culture-obsessed (or alternatively, a cult leader). This was not charity: by building a strong culture, I believe we were able to execute better and faster than others, and this capacity to predictably out-execute the market became a core part of our strategy. This is a playbook for how I think about building and scaling culture from the ground up. Principle 1: Be intentional in designing culture for a purpose. I’ve focused on designing cultures to optimize for company velocity . Principle 2: There are low-hanging ways to add velocity to every organization. Principle 3: Great culture has a defensible network effect. Principle 4: ~70% of culture is people. Obsess over recruiting, growing great people, and firing low performers. Principle 5: Keep control of hiring as long as possible. Principle 6: Mediocrity is the default as you scale. Fight to retain exceptionalism. Principle 7: Sweat the small things to add “antibodies.” Principle 8: Write down what makes culture distinctive. Evangelize these points and fight to keep them alive as long as it makes sense for your strategy. Principle 9: Stay lean as much as possible. Principle 10: Devote energy to reprogramming external hires. Principle 11: Distinctive culture unlocks distinctive strategy. Principle 12: Evolve intentionally. *** Principle 1: Be intentional in designing culture for a purpose. I’ve focused on designing cultures to optimize for company velocity . For most companies, culture is seen as a set of talking points that make the team feel good, but is not especially actionable (i.e. “we believe in teamwork, integrity, and winning!”) For some companies, building a distinctive culture is seen as a way to attract and retain good employees — but is not directly aligned to company strategy (i.e. tech companies offering lots of snacks and ping-pong tables). For the best companies, culture is treated as a purposeful part of the company’s strategy to differentiate on some axis . While there are many areas where a company can decide to differentiate, for most technology companies, I believe that speed of effective execution is the single biggest cultural determinant of success. For many of the best companies, the biggest commonality is that they simply move at a different pace than any others: being able to quickly iterate on ideas, capitalize on opportunities, close the next partnership, and ship the next product compounds exponentially, and can set companies apart. As a result — we focused on velocity as the key objective in developing culture at LiveRamp and Datavant. Principle 2: There are low-hanging ways to add velocity to every organization. I believe that a substantial amount of slack exists in every company; almost no organizations operate near the efficient frontier where speed needs to come with a tradeoff against quality, budget, or other constraints. So a key role of leaders is to set the pace and attempt to eliminate that slack. ( Amp It Up and Hustle as a Strategy are both great reads with the same overarching philosophy.) Here are a few approaches I’ve used to amplify speed: 1. Have high expectations on speed. In general, leaders should make it clear that they expect things to move quickly and set the pace in the organization. Turnaround time is often a cultural norm that can be tweaked. For example, at Datavant & LiveRamp, we had a norm of replying to all emails within 24-hours at the latest; just that expectation alone meant that small things wouldn’t be bottlenecked for a few days while it sat in somebody’s inbox, but didn’t add more work. Similarly, we tried to turn contracts around quickly, escalate decisions that weren’t quickly settled, make same-day decisions about candidates, and generally run at a different pace than “normal.” 2. Clarity of strategy. Extreme clarity of strategy makes it easy for people across the organization to weigh tradeoffs and make decisions. If you survey five people, and all five of them agree on “what are the most important priorities this month/quarter/year” — that makes decision-making much easier across the company; most companies fail this test, which causes micro-decisions to escalate. CEOs can drive clarity of strategy by committing to a definitive view of the future (and your company’s place in it), communicating this view clearly, and being willing to say “we are not going in X direction;” often CEOs try too hard to protect optionality and as a result lose this strategic clarity — slowing the company down. 3. Great internal communications & transparency of information . In addition to sharing strategy, sharing all sorts of information as context helps individuals across the company make better decisions. I put a lot of investment in internal communications: making sure people know the information they need to make good decisions. Part of this was extreme transparency (sharing full financials, board decks, bad news, making calendars public, etc.), part of this was designing cadences for visibility (company-wide public status updates and OKRs, “red event” escalation, customer email aliases, etc.), and part of this was focus on curating information for the team (thoughtful team meeting topics, thoughtful team emails, etc.). Being the communicator-in-chief is probably the single most important part of a CEOs job — and is critical to unlocking speed. 4. Clarity of decision rights . A lot of decisions get bottlenecked on who the decision-maker is ; without clarity, there is a push for consensus-driven decision-making. A key role of the CEO is to make it clear who owns what and how decisions should get made. For example, I often made it clear that the Product team was the tie-breaker in lots of decisions; I made it clear that I was not the decision-maker even when I had an opinion; I would clearly make someone “quarterback” on a specific initiative; etc. 5. Good org design. Until ~100 employees, org design doesn’t matter that much; the key is to just have your best leaders run key parts of the business. Once you cross 100 employees, org design matters as a flow of information and decision-making — and it becomes key to constantly adapt the org structure to make decisions quickly. 6. Caliber of people. I’ll discuss this in more detail below, but having extremely high-caliber people is critical for velocity. People who are high throughput move faster, but more importantly — the ability to trust that others will make high-quality decisions and have high-quality follow-through allows much more organizational throughput. 7. Empowerment. Much of the above (high-caliber people, clear strategy, good communications, etc.) are necessary ingredients to really be able to empower people — but if you accomplish all of those, you can then make it clear that people are empowered (and expected) to make decisions themselves and run quickly. Principle 3: Great culture has a defensible network effect. Like many of the most important aspects of strategy, company culture has strong network effects.​​ A strong culture directly drives great results — it means your company is wired to execute better than others on some dimension. For example, if you are faster than other companies…that speed compounds quarter after quarter in your results. Superstars are attracted to environments with strong cultures. For example, Datavant’s focus on velocity and the empowerment that came with that has made it an attractive place for ambitious people who want to maximize personal growth, which in turn has helped us get exceptional talent. Superstars are also attracted to great results. Hypergrowth, compelling corporate milestones, and the swagger of winning attracts many people to the team. Superstars directly help the results of the company Superstars also help shape the culture. For example, autonomy of decision-making is much easier to take hold as a cultural practice in an environment of superstars (where distributed decision-making is typically good) than in an environment of mediocre performance Winning reinforces the culture, and makes the cultural practices stick over time Like any virtuous cycle, this means that a great company can sustainably outperform others as long as the flywheel continues spinning; this means that a company with a superior culture can sustainably outperform a company with more capital or other resources. If any of the pillars are missing, this can quickly turn into a vicious cycle. Many companies compromise on the caliber of their team at some point or have a bad year or two at some point — which creates a spiral towards mediocrity if not carefully managed. Principle 4: ~70% of culture is people. Obsess over recruiting, growing great people, and firing low performers. When people have asked me about the culture of various organizations I’ve led, I’ve always started by describing how we think about talent. The reality is: if you accept having mediocre people, it’s hard to have a great culture. This isn’t just about having a top-tier of exceptional performers internally, or even a strong median employee; it’s about making sure there’s great talent across the organization . Many cultural practices (good or bad) are based on the talent level of the organization. For example, in an environment where team members are consistently high-performing, micromanagement is a counterproductive strategy by managers; in an environment where performance is mixed, micromanagement becomes more rational. So in environments where you can trust that those around you are high performing, practices evolve that are much more productive. To ensure a high level of talent across the board, the CEO needs to: Obsess over attracting great talent (I’ve always assumed I should spend ~20% of my time recruiting at any given moment, across stages) Build a recruiting machine to default to no and only hire superstars. Grow great people. The highest-performers are usually quick learners, and so can double their productivity year-over-year if consistently placed in stretch roles. Building the muscle for this is key. Obsess over retaining great people. It’s almost always worth the fight to keep the best people. Build the processes to fire low performers. For any manager who is human, firing someone is the hardest decision they make in business; they want to give low performers the benefit of the doubt and find a way to make it work, both for empathetic reasons and due to fears of what will happen without someone in a seat. But the reality is this instinct is counterproductive and sets a low bar for performance. This means that the CEO needs to help create the process to create a high performance bar to stay at the company. Principle 5: Keep control of hiring as long as possible. As a corollary to Principle 4…while I am generally an extreme delegator, hiring is the one area of the company where I believe I should bias towards micromanagement. It’s simply too easy for a few compromise hires in one function to break the whole culture of the organization. Principle 6: Mediocrity is the default as you scale. Fight to retain exceptionalism. By definition, most companies are average/mediocre, and many forces will conspire to try to make an exceptional company revert to mediocrity. Part of your job is to fight this descent to mediocrity as a company grows by continuing to set high standards, by being uncompromising to short-term tradeoffs against culture, by communicating what makes the company distinctive, and by staying relentless on talent. The network effects of great culture will help you maintain exceptionalism if you keep it as a priority, but the moment you deprioritize culture, reversion to the mean takes over. Principle 7: Sweat the small things to add “antibodies.” One way to scale an exceptional culture is to develop internal “antibodies” to counter-cultural behaviors. When there is a critical mass of “true believers” on core cultural principles, deviations from cultural values are quickly identified and flagged. For example, in an environment where it was a cultural practice to respond to emails quickly, I rapidly heard about a new executive who was flaky on email and could quickly give feedback; in an environment that values “default to no” hiring, the team pushes back when a manager tries to make compromise hires. The antibodies are extremely valuable to make people flag and take action to course correct problems. In order to maintain cultural antibodies, you need a critical mass of true believers, and you also need to ensure that this group doesn’t burn out — if there are too many deviations, they will stop fighting. So to get there, you need to initially “sweat the small things” — and champion fixing the minor broken windows. If you do this successfully, it empowers the antibodies that create a positive feedback cycle on culture. Principle 8: Write down what makes culture distinctive. Evangelize these points and fight to keep them alive as long as it makes sense for your strategy. Too often, cultural value documents are platitudes that everyone agrees on. What’s most powerful for cultural value documents is a set of principles that make you distinctive . These should be distinctive features of the company that you aspire to scale, and they should be guiding principles to the team in moments of tradeoffs. For example, a value like “We celebrate success as a team” is not especially helpful (even if it’s a good thing to do); it’s not distinctive, and there are rarely situations where it truly guides behavior. Instead, a value like “We focus on promoting from within wherever possible” can be a very distinctive position for a company, and one that can guide decisions during real tradeoffs. Similarly, we thought a lot about what made us distinctive for talent. There are many great companies on lots of different dimensions that candidates care about (ranging from compensation to prestige to balance to impact); we realized that we could be okay at lots of those dimensions, but we could uniquely aspire to be the best place in the world for personal growth . That became a facet of our culture we doubled down on, and a type of candidate we aimed to attract. By writing down the distinctive portions of a culture, it amplifies the things that make you exceptional, and helps to empower the antibodies. Principle 9: Stay lean as much as possible. While leanness is currently popular for financial reasons , I believe it’s even more important for cultural reasons . Everything about culture is easier with a smaller team than a larger team: communication is easier, keeping a high talent bar is easier, and cultivating true believers is easier. I believe that a high-performing team of 500 people usually only has ~2x the output of a high-performing team of 50 people; complexity scales exponentially with team size. As a result, it’s worth it to hire an expensive high-performer who can do the work of 1.5 medium performers; it’s worth it to fight harder to standardize and automate; and it’s worth it to push back on unnecessary hiring; it’s worth it to push the team on how to accomplish more with less. Principle 10: Devote energy to reprogramming external hires. With distinctive cultural values and practices, your organization can become too internally-focused, and not bring in senior complimentary influences from the outside world. You want to make sure that you hire well externally, but senior external hires always come with cultural baggage and ways they’ve done business in the past. It’s worth spending the time with new hires to actively coach them towards the distinctive aspects of your culture, and “reprogram” them on key dimensions; you can walk them through what makes your culture distinctive out of the gate, you can use a 90-day structured feedback session, and you can frequently give micro-coaching in 1:1’s. Bringing in outside perspectives unlocks much greater performance, but you need to make sure you aren’t sacrificing what makes you distinctive in the process. Principle 11: Distinctive culture unlocks distinctive strategy. As you build a distinctive culture, there are types of opportunities that your company becomes uniquely good at seizing. For example, by obsessing over velocity at Datavant, we knew that we could move at 2–10x the pace of most other companies, and we made product, marketing, and sales strategy decisions with that assumption in mind. For example, we built our entire initial marketing strategy around trying to put on the best conference of thought leaders in healthcare; while this wasn’t an especially novel idea, we were simply able to out-execute others and make it happen in a way most companies couldn’t. So based on our strategic decisions around culture, we established competitive advantages that informed our marketing strategy decisions downstream. By developing strengths as an organization, you can then build a strategy that caters to those strengths — and out-execute on a variety of dimensions. Principle 12: Evolve intentionally. The culture that was successful for one stage of growth may not be the same culture that is critical for the next phase of growth. While velocity is a valuable objective across stages, underlying tactics may change over time, especially when undergoing a major change. For example, in shifting from one product to multiple products, in trying to put more emphasis on profitability over growth, in trying to integrate after M&A, or in trying to go more enterprise / international / new market, some of the existing practices may no longer be right for the next stage. On some frequency, it’s worth questioning what cultural practices are still accelerants for your go-forward strategy — and evolving intentionally.","Fri, 10 Nov 2023 01:32:42 GMT"
