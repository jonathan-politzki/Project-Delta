Deep Learning's Future,https://jonathanpolitzki.substack.com/p/deep-learnings-future,"Machine Learning‚ÄúEverything should be as simple as it can be, but not simpler‚Äù - Albert EinsteinThanks for reading Engineering the Future! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.SubscribePurpose of this Write UpThe goal of this exercise is to map out the foundational principles of machine learning in a ‚Äúsimple,‚Äù Occam‚Äôs Razor type of way. They say the best way to learn is to teach. I have been readingDeep Learningby Ian Goodfellow and have made it through the foundations of these models. Chapter 9 onward appears to be much more practical applications and it makes sense for me to put down the book and synthesize the 320 pages of hard math/concepts by writing and working on projects (I learn by doing).What follows below is an overview of chapters 1-8, some derived principles of deep learning that we can use to properly frame the future we are entering, and lastly an annoyingly over-philosophical take on all that is occurring that I couldn't help but write down.Occam‚Äôs RazorIn the above quote, Einstein echoes Occam‚Äôs Razor, the principle that if you have two competing ideas to explain the same phenomenon, you should prefer the simpler one. This concept is also foundational to machine learning. If your model is too complex, you overfit, if it is too simple and abstract, you don‚Äôt capture the phenomenon accurately. I‚Äôve written aboutAbstraction vs First Principlesbefore.Summary of Deep LearningLet me just start by saying that this was in no way an easy read and was rather exhausting. The book summarizes mostly theoretical but also practical concepts as was the state-of-the-art in 2016.In many ways, the field of machine learning is changing rapidly. Yet in many ways, the principles have remained constant over time. While 8 years ago, the book holds up really well.There is a lot of pure math. I don‚Äôt have that kind of background, but I‚Äôm slowly absorbing concepts. While the equations are individually really difficult, the general framework for the types of equations that are used is relatively simple. But the theory really diverges in a lot of instances, leaving me to really hope libraries such as pytorch will save me from mathematical hell.While I am documenting the big ideas, it is also important to understand these concepts from the lower-level so that working with them from a higher-level programming standpoint becomes more intuitive.Chapters covered so far:IntroductionLinear AlgebraProbability and Information TheoryNumerical ComputationMachine Learning BasicsDeep Feedforward NetworksRegularization for Deep LearningOptimization for Training Deep Models1. IntroductionWhat is AI? On a high level, the best description I can give of machine learning, that both captures its technical essence and the magnitude of implications is thatAI is a new computer. AI is a probabilistic computer.The intuitive way to think about this is, say I give you a picture of a dog. Given the input data (binary, pixelated image of dog), what is the likely output? We take for granted that in our brain, we have a complex web of neurons that fire up when we see many features of the image that our brain automatically identifies as a dog. An ML algorithm works in a similar way.AI is a Probability MachineA machine learning program is said to learn from experience E with respect to task T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.In this case:E = experience = data input = i.e. 1280 x 720 pixel image resembling a dogT = classify what is in the imageP = accuracy of the output. If you identified 99/100 dogs correctly, your P is 0.99, pretty good!To restate the operation we calculated, either in our heads or with a computer: p(y|x) What is the conditional probability of y given x? Given x data (E), what is the probable output? Dog.ChatGPT, similarly is essentially, given your input text, what is the likely output text? Starting with next word prediction, given ‚ÄúThe,‚Äù what is the likely next word, similar to autofill on your iPhone.Frequentist vs Bayesian StatisticsProbability is mostly broken into two camps. Frequentist methods focus on discrete sets of observed data and long-term frequencies, providing straightforward estimation and hypothesis testing techniques. On the other hand, Bayesian approaches consider previous assumptions and quantify uncertainty using posterior distributions. I think of this as ‚Äúthis is what I believed before and with this much room for error, after the new thing I just saw, this is now what I think generally and with this much error.‚ÄùFrequentist - Solely uses observable data. More simple and commonly used in simple systems. Discrete.Bayesian - Incorporates prior knowledge, creates beliefs, and updates posterior distributions using observed data. Continuous.Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep LearningBe wary when people use the term AI‚Äìit is annoyingly broad and includes simplistic linear functions that you learned in middle school. AI can include simple if-then statements. This technically fits the probabilistic definition we mentioned earlier, but it is just not that impressive.Machine learning goes deeper but still in a simpler, hands-on way than deep learning that requires less data. While deep learning is an exciting field, the fundamentals of machine learning are necessary to understand its progress, and there are many instances where ML is a more effective tool than DL.We should remember that deep learning is included within machine learning, albeit in a less structured way that relies on large amounts of data and generalized structure to self-learn. Deep learning has risen to prominence as society enters a regime of mass data and computation, where it has proven itself to exceed human levels of pattern recognition than even humans in chess, go, and now some parts of language.Training, Supervised Learning, and Unsupervised LearningWhen you are building any one of these models, you feed the model data. This data can be raw, or it can contain features. Raw data would be like feeding the model stock price data over time as a string of price values. A feature would be like taking price and dividing it by earnings, creating a price/earnings ratio, which may be a valuable, man-made data point for the model to learnSupervised learning is when you train a model on both input and the output. This would be like if you fed images of a cat with the label of ‚Äòcat‚Äô and images of a dog with the label ‚Äòdog‚Äô.Unsupervised learning would be like if you fed cat and dog images with no labels and asked the computer to simply figure out the difference between the two. Unsupervised learning aims to find hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in data. While the use of unsupervised methods such as Principal Components Analysis (PCA) has advanced, the effectiveness of unsupervised learning has been disappointing to date.2. Linear AlgebraThe purpose of me writing this isn‚Äôt to go super deep into the math, rather to extract the intuition in a simple way. But some of the math will be necessary to go on. To set the stage, I will introduce an example. Say you are building a model that takes in 5 variables to predict an employee‚Äôs salary. The variables are all numeric and this is run by a linear regression model.Years of EducationYears of ExperienceMarket Capitalization of the Company ($mm)Hours worked per week# of SubordinatesWe log these variables as a vector in ‚Äúfeature space.‚Äù Feature space is a helpful way to visualize our features in ‚Äúabstract vector space‚Äù. The vectorx= [x1,x2,x3,x4,x5] where x inputs are represented as xiscalars.If there were two variables, one can easily imagine plotting these points into a graph that looks something like this. You could also imagine graphing 3 variables in 3-dimensional ‚Äúfeature space.‚Äù This, however, is where our natural conception of space leaves us. What about 4 variables, 5, what about 1,000? What does that look like?The best method I‚Äôve heard to date is pioneered by leading researcher,Geoffrey Hinton. It goes as such: you look at a 3-dimensional graph and say 5 really loud!Matrix MultiplicationThere‚Äôs a lot here on matrix multiplication. I‚Äôm just dismayed that my 6th grade teacher was right and I did need to know this stuff after all. For the math to be clean, matrix multiplication requires conformable matrices.Dot Product is important when we take two equal length vectors or matrices and combine them into a single value. This is a computationally inexpensive way of reducing matrices into a scalar.Eigendecomposition [video] is a method used to decompose a matrix into a set of eigenvectors and eigenvalues. This is pretty hard for me to work with.3. Probability and Information TheoryProbability theory is a mathematical framework for representing uncertain statements. Information theory is a branch of mathematics that revolves around quantifying how much information is present in a signal. The basic intuition behind information theory is that unlikely information is more valuable than likely information. (Information Theory of Startups - 2024)Conditional Probability - a relatively simple concept that we discussed earlier. P(y|x).Expectation, Variance, and CovarianceAnother important concept is the ‚ÄúExpectation‚Äù denominated ùîº. P in this sense is a complete distribution and p if it is a sample set. So we can calculate this in both a discrete, limited way and a continuous way.This reads as: ‚ÄúThe ‚Äòexpectation‚Äô or expected value of x drawn from set P is the sum of f(x) times P(x) for all possible values of x.‚Äùùîºx~P [f(x)] =P(x)f(x)Bayes‚Äô RuleOften, we find ourself in a situation where we need to know P(y|x) and need to know P(x|y). If we know P(x), we can compute this using Bayes‚Äô Rule, which will also come in more handy later.Bayesian Inference is a method of statistical inference in which Bayes' theorem is used to update the probability for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available. This is learning in action. When you type words into ChatGPT, there is also an inference occurring. The model is learning from your input text and it is updating its context of the situation. Mechanics below:Initialize the parameters Œ∏ with a prior belief.For each data point or batch of data, compute the likelihood.Update the posterior distribution using the likelihood and prior.This process iteratively refines the parameter estimates.Lastly, variance, covariance, and standard deviation are very important calculations in MLCovariance gives a sense of how two values are related. InProject Delta ‚àÜ,we used a cov. matrixVariance tells us how close our expected values are to the actual values.Standard deviation is the sqrt of the variance4. Numerical ComputationThis is a relatively short chapter, which is good, because it highlights really just one super important concept.Gradient-Based OptimizationRemember when we talked about E, T, and P? We are optimizing task T by maximizing performance P given experience E.This is the most important concept of machine learning. Using the loss function, which is essentially all of the ‚Äúexpected values‚Äù compared to the ‚Äúactual values‚Äù and the difference between the two representing error, we can optimize the function by minimizing the error. In other words, we are aiming to minimize the sum of each P(y|x).In linear, 2-dimensional convex space, this is super straightforward. You can optimize by finding the derivative = 0. In 3-dimensional space, it becomes more difficult but still simple with convex mapping. When there are multiple local minima, like in the picture on the right, it becomes more difficult.Optimization is achieved by taking the derivative of the loss function, which gives us the slope of the function at that point. Now that we know the slope, we know the optimal step to descend the hill. Best case, we converge at the global minimum rather than falling into local minima (or saddle regions discussed later). Here, our variables have been optimized to the best fit equation.Stochastic Gradient DescentAn extension of gradient descent, which is often considered slow and unreliable. This is the most used training methodology, often paired with momentum. Often, a small batch of samples (1-100) are drawn uniformly from the training set.For large models, this is much quicker and does a reasonably good job. In many cases, the exact minimum is not needed. Local minima will often do just fine and so a computationally efficient way to drive reasonably good results is what is used.5. Machine Learning BasicsIn contrast to the above chapter, there is a ton of stuff in here. I am going to try to keep it simple. This was a great chapter that tied together all of the math we learned so far.Basic types of learning algorithms:ClassificationClassification with Missing inputsRegressionTranscriptionMachine translationStructured outputAnomaly detectionSynthesis and samplingImputation of missing valuesDenoisingDensity estimation and probability mass function estimationThe Training ProcessThe model is usually trained on a training set of the training data. This does not include the validation set data. ~80% is used for the training subset and learning the parameters and ~20% for the validation subset and estimating the generalization error. Though there are different strategies for this.HyperparametersThere are many indirectly important parameters, hyperparameters, that direct the learning process and control the algorithm‚Äôs behavior. These may be tuned through methods such as grid search or random search.Strength of weight decay: ŒªCapacity: degree of the polynomialLearning rateModel LayersEpochsBuilding a Machine Learning AlgorithmThe recipe for building an algorithm is relatively simple in concept:Use a specification of a datasetTie a cost function to performance relative to a taskMinimize a cost function using an optimization algorithmDesign decisionsChoosing the optimizerChoosing the cost functionChoosing the form of the output unitsFeedforward networks also introduce two new conceptsHidden LayersActivation FunctionsLayers and units per layer.First Layer: h(1) =g(1)(W(1)Tx+b(1))h = hidden layerg = activation functionW = weight matrixx = input vector of the NN - the raw features fed into the input layer essentiallyb = bias vectorManifold LearningThemanifold, as it ties to feature space and representation mapping, is probably my favorite concept in all of machine learning, yet also the most difficult to work with. The book outlines the manifold in the context of machine learning as ‚Äúa connected set of points that can be approximated well by considering only a small number of degrees of freedom, or dimensions, embedded in a higher-dimensional space.Put simply, you can imagine that multidimensional space, such as a 3-dimensional representation of the earth, has a 2-dimensional manifold like a giant piece of paper within. This is useful in the sense that we can take representations and reduce them into lower dimensional space, which may reasonably capture the concepts.When I think of the manifold, I imagine computation space similar to how Stephen Wolfram definesRulial Spaceand generative AI space [video]. You see there are sparse islands in what is regarded as massive interconcept space. Take for instance the below gradient of possible concepts of cat pictures. If you move far in a particular direction, you may charter into ‚Äúdog‚Äù concept space, where the pictures begin looking like a cat-dog and eventually a dog.For many reasons, this is probably one of the most important paradigms of AI. Interconcept space contains all possible concepts. Some not yet explored by human minds. One begins to imagine a world where a computer is left to iterate through interconcept space and explore various ideas, validating them, and becoming creative in its own way, innovating faster than any human could.InProject Delta ‚àÜ, we also explore the potential to map ourselves, our identities, our writings, etc into interconcept space. By breaking down these concepts into detailed concepts and comparing them to others or other concepts, we can begin to define the fundamental nature of ourselves and benchmark it to society. The use cases here are endless.Themanifold hypothesisis that the probability distribution over images, text strings and sounds occurring in real life are extremely concentrated.6. Deep Feedforward NetworksThe model is provided with inputs in the form of variables and the model applies weights to the variables as optimized through a process called backpropagation, which is essentially just optimizing the gradient that we discussed prior.As the inputs flow through the hidden layer(s), the model learns the relationships between them and the output on its own. This complex learning is the backbone of the advancements in modern AI. According to Goodfellow,‚ÄúFollowing the success of back-propagation, neural network research gained popularity and reached a peak in the early 1990s. Afterwards, other machine learning techniques became more popular until the modern deep learning renaissance that began in 2006.Most of the improvement [between 1986 and 2015 can be attributed to larger datasets and computers].‚ÄùNon-LinearityMachine learning creates a linear model that represents the underlying data. This is problematic as there are many functions that can not be represented in a purely linear way. These problems are solved through the introduction of activation functions (most prominently ReLU, rectified linear unit) that act similarly to human synapses and introduce non-linearity to enable the model to perform better. For small datasets, using rectifying non-linearities is more important than learning the weights of the hidden layers.Non-linear models can no longer be solved in closed form but the advantages usually outweigh this fault and an iterative model for minimizing loss such as gradient descent is used.7. Regularization for Deep LearningA central problem in machine learning is creating models that not only perform well on the training data but also onnew inputs.This requires generalization. Regularization offers up many methods in order to improve models ability to generalize on new data.Some methods of regularization.Boldrepresents areas of interest for me.L1 and L2 Parameter Regularization: parameter norm penalties that inhibit over-emphasis on various parameter weights.Noise Robustness: purposefully introduce noise as an effective form of regularizationDataset augmentation: introducing more data, even in synthetic form.Early stopping: not allowing model to overfitParameter tying and parameter sharingBagging and Ensemble Methods: train models separately and average themDropout: computationally inexpensive way bagging by randomly pruning nodes and forcing generalizationTangent Distance, Tangent Prop, and Manifold Tangent ClassifierAdversarial training: use the model to identify examples the model misclassified and works backwards to correctSemi-supervised learning: tying a relationship between unlabeled and labeled dataMultitask Learning: pooling examples from multiple learning tasks so that the models generalize. Multitask learning may hold significant breakthroughs for the field of deep learning.Building a single machine learning system that can handle millions of tasks, and that can learn to successfully accomplish new tasks automatically, is a true grand challenge in the field of artificial intelligence and computer systems engineering.8. Optimization for Training Deep ModelsThis doesn‚Äôt feel like a very useful introductory chapter for me right now other than the basic idea that when training a model, there are many ways to then optimize it.Chapters and methods:Empirical risk minimizationSurrogate loss functions and early stoppingBatch and minibatch algorithmsPlateus, saddle points, and other flat regionsCliffs and exploding gradientsLong-term dependenciesInexact gradientsPoor correspondence between local and global structureTheoretical limits of optimizationBasic algorithms: SGD + momentum most notablyParameter initialization strategiesAlgorithms and adaptive learning rates: AdaGrad, RMSProp, AdamApproximate second-order methodsNewton‚Äôs methodConjugate gradientsBFGSContinuation methods and curriculum learningSome Interesting notes:Nearly any deep model is essentially guaranteed to have a large number of local minimaIn high-dimensional spaces, local minima are rare, and saddle points are more common‚ÄúIt is more important to choose a model family that is easy to optimize than a powerful optimization algorithm‚ÄùTrends/PrinciplesThere are some general trends we can identify as these technologies scale and become more useful. These trends are important to identify as we extrapolate use cases across industries and project out performance, which is often on an exponential ramp, into the future. There are also some paradoxes, unintuitive realizations, and unsolved mysteries that I will note.I plan to add to this list over the years.Principle 1: The Bitter LessonWhile not explicitly cited in the book, there are many parallel threads to Rich Sutton‚Äôs famous passage onThe Bitter Lessonafter 70 years of AI research.‚ÄúThe biggest lesson that can be read from 70 years of AI research is that general methods that leveragecomputation are ultimately the most effective, and by a large margin‚ÄùHumans are stubborn in thinking that there must be ways that our thinking is special. We aren‚Äôt special. Any hard-coded algorithms, special features, or attempts to mimic the human brain are steamrolled by large amounts of computation, data, and general methods in the long run. This is best seen in the success of DeepMind beating Kasparov in chess and the difficult-to-explain effectiveness of overparameterization. This brings me to principle 2.Principle 2: The Big 3 - Talent, Data, and ComputationOn a meta-note for the productivity of these models, if you want to build performant models, you can‚Äôt skimp on either of these three important resources. The confluence of these exponentially growing forces leads us into a future we cannot predict.Talent: you need leading researchers, scientists, and engineers to build models that avoid pitfalls and maximize performanceData: Machine learning is just sexy statistical modeling on top of data. If your data is corrupt, everything is broken. There is a nuance to this, that it seems massive amounts of data (scraping the internet) can outperform lesser amounts of clean data.Compute: In order to run large scale models, large computation on a level orders of magnitude greater than you can imagine is needed.Proxy for Talent: Research Papers - One strong indicator is the number of papers posted to the machine learning‚Äìrelated categories of arXiv, a popular paper preprint hosting service, with more than thirty-two times as many paper preprints posted in 2018 as in 2009 (a growth rate of more thandouble every two years).[Would like to include a log graph of # of people in the space, computation dedicated towards it, and quantity of available data.]Principle 3: Exponential Growth in ModelsAt the time of this book being published, artificial neural networks doubled in size roughly every 2.4 years.This has since accelerated beyond Moore‚Äôs law.Since 2010, during the deep learning era we now find ourselves, the training compute used to create AI models has beengrowing at a rate of 4.1x per year. Most of this growth comes fromincreased spending, althoughimprovements in hardwarehave also played a role.Interactive Compute GraphandParameter Graph.If we assume this trend to continue forward, these models will have 1,342,265x more compute at scale in 10 years.How does that change our world? Do we even have the infrastructure to sustain such a change?A Golden Decade of Deep Learning: Computing Systems & Applications[Jeff Dean, Spring 2022]‚ÄúIn 1990, we needed about one million times more computational power, not sixty-four times, for neural networks to start making impressive headway on challenging problems! Starting in about 2008, though, thanks to Moore‚Äôs law, we started to have computers this powerfulIn 2004, we saw a nearly twenty-fold improvement for a neural network algorithm using a GPU. In 2008, computer scientist Rajat Raina and colleagues demonstrated speedups of as much as 72.6 times from using a GPU versus the best CPU-based implementation for some unsupervised learning algorithms.‚ÄùThere are many variables that determine the growth of model power, and it is hard to pin down what the estimated growth in capability will be.Principle 4: No Free Lunch TheoremTheory stating that: averaged over all possible data-generating distributions, every classification algorithm has the same error rate when classifying previously unobserved points. Said differently, no machine learning algorithm is universally any better than any other.Core Idea: NFLT states that no single algorithm performs best on all possible problems. Performance averages out across all possible tasks, meaning an algorithm that excels in one domain may perform poorly in another.Principle 5: The Curse of DimensionalityThe ""curse of dimensionality"" refers to various phenomena that arise when analyzing and organizing data in high-dimensional spaces. These challenges become increasingly significant as the number of dimensions (features) grows. Here are the key aspects of the curse of dimensionality:Increased Computational Complexity: As the number of dimensions increases, the computational cost for algorithms grows exponentially. This includes both the time required for computation and the amount of memory needed.Sparsity of Data: In high-dimensional spaces, data points become exponentially far from each other, creating difficulty identifying meaningful patterns or clusters. Similarly, in high-dimensional spaces, the distances between points tend to become more uniform. Given different clusters of data are similarly spaced, it makes it difficult to distinguish between them.EtcPrinciple 6: Universal Approximation TheoremIn simple words, the universal approximation theorem says that neural networks can approximate any function. One can imagine that a computer can do anything, withstanding the possibility that we live in a computationally irreducible world, as Wolfram says.‚ÄúStates that a feedforward network with a linear output layer and at least one hidden layer with any ‚Äòsquashing‚Äô activation function (such as the logistic sigmoid) can approximate any Borel measurable function from one finite-dimensional space to another with any desired nonzero amount of error, provided that the network is given enough hidden units.‚ÄùAPPENDIXComputational Framework for the BrainThe most fascinating part of all the Machine Learning research I‚Äôve done to date, starting with work at Quant, Nephra, CS 440 (Artificial Intelligence), and independent research, is that it‚Äôs provided me with a surprisingly useful framework to view the world. At times more useful than anything I‚Äôve learned in psychology, the foundations of machine learning foundationally define learning and how the mind works that picks up where many qualitative models of psychology leave off.The most humbling lesson of all is just how seemingly fast these models are taking off. The uniqueness of human intelligence is put into question. Computers are on track to exponentially outstrip our intelligence to make us the future equivalent of ants. We can debate when that day will come, but it‚Äôs no longer a question of if, and it seems increasingly likely that it will be in our lifetime.In an always prescient 2007 glance into the future, Thiel describes an inevitable world of volatile risk, where technology bears the potential energy to wipe out everything we love. How does one prepare for such a future?(Trimmed)‚ÄúBut the world has not yet come to an end, and there is no easy telling how long the twilight of the modern age will endure. What then must be done, by the Christian statesman or stateswoman aspiring to be a wise steward for our time?The negative answers are straightforward. There can be no return to the archaic world or even to the robust conception of the political envisioned by Carl Schmitt.Unlike Strauss, the Christian statesman or stateswoman knows that the modern age will not be permanent, and ultimately will give way to something very different.And so, in determining the correct mixture of violence and peace, the Christian statesman or stateswoman would be wise, in every close case, to side with peace. There is no formula to answer the critical question of what constitutes a ‚Äúclose case‚Äù; that must be decided in every specific instance. It may well be that the cumulative decisions made in all those close instances will determine the destiny of the postmodern world. For that world could differ from the modern world in a way that is much worse or much better‚Äîthe limitless violence of runaway mimesis or the peace of the kingdom of God.‚ÄùPeter Thiel,The Straussian MomentThe Singularity, the Capitalist, and the TechnologistIt is alarming that today can be viewed as the twilight of the modern age. How did we get here? And why doesn‚Äôt anyone seem to acknowledge this reality?‚ÄúThe technological singularity is a hypothetical future point in time at which technological growth becomes uncontrollable and irreversible, resulting in unforeseeable consequences for human civilization.‚ÄùThere is a movement, e/acc (effective accelerationism), that is terribly misguided in this sense. The optimistic case for tech is always that ‚Äúhumans find a way to contain it.‚Äù But there is a real sense in which that is impossible in this case. And where humans are either killed off entirely or forced to integrate. In which case, you stumble upon unanswerable questions of whether you‚Äôre still human at all?Self-interested capitalists, and I‚Äôd argue now technologists, build the thing that will kill them.‚ÄúWhen it comes time to hang the capitalists, they will vie with each other for the rope contract.‚Äù - Lenin‚ÄúWhy does Frankenstein create the Monster? Frankenstein believes that by creating the Monster, he can discover the secrets of ‚Äúlife and death,‚Äù create a ‚Äúnew species,‚Äù and learn how to ‚Äúrenew life.‚Äù He is motivated to attempt these things by ambition. He wants to achieve something great, even if it comes at great cost.‚ÄùJust as the capitalists vie for the rope contract, the naive technologists, out of pride, end the world they hoped to save.Thanks for reading Engineering the Future!

Entrepreneurial Risk,https://jonathanpolitzki.substack.com/p/entrepreneurial-risk,"Risk BreakdownPeople are not good at calculating risk. Risk can be broken down into (1) the actual estimation of likelihood of failure / downside calculation, and (2) the outcome in the result of failure / what does failure really represent.People are also not good at calculating upside, which can be broken down in a similar way of (2) chance of outcome and (2) the reward.The reason for this is there is a human aspect to risk. Humans aren‚Äôt computers. Also, what is the risk of never doing anything meaningful with your life?Risk in Entrepreneurship Doesn‚Äôt Check Out (In Theory)If you were to create a ‚Äúrisk model of entrepreneurship,‚Äù the clear and obvious output would be to not engage. Most startups fail. Most ideas are worthless. Most people shouldn‚Äôt be entrepreneurs. There‚Äôs a power law that works against you. The list goes on.In contrast, actuaries and hedge funds can take broad portfolios of stocks and, using statistics and math, create reliable and relatively precise models around upside/downside cases to predict risk.We Should Trust Our Brains and Instincts MoreWe seem to forget that while we have calculators in our pockets, we are still the most intelligent animal on the planet, more intelligent than any risk model. You should ask yourself when the last time you truly identified and solved an important problem was? I can‚Äôt really even remember. Society isn‚Äôt structured in that way. You are always carrying out processes for others. As a young person, you are supposed to question the system. It has always been that way. And the older systems will never reward irreverence.The Reality is Wandering, Learning, and CreatingWe should trust and let our brain, heart, and instincts guide us.Startups/Entrepreneurs shouldn‚Äôt view risk the same way investors should. The reason is it is impossible to predict 1 and 2 for both upside and downside. During the early stages of an invention, for instance, it is just an idea thread that tugs at your curiosity. Only after pulling on it for extended periods of time, talking to others about it, and learning intensely, do you start to see what that invention could or could not be.I‚Äôve always viewed these things as white sheets of paper. For every new thing I‚Äôve worked on, it‚Äôs always started with just a thought written on a piece of paper. A grain of sand in the universe. After extended periods of time of letting your curiosity guide you, you start mapping out the problem and its surface area expands. The paper becomes 10 pages, 50 pages, pruned down to 25 pages again, then 70 pages‚Ä¶ You are literally creating enthalpy of the universe‚Äôs entropy. You are connecting ambiguous dots and organizing them in a way which has actual value. The paper lengthening doesn‚Äôt have value in itself. It only matters in the sense that it is a projection of your brain thinking through the concepts, mapping out the area, solving the problem, and learning.The vast majority of the time, you are just wasting your breath. Most ideas have no real value, even when mapped out. They may not be profitable, no one really cares, there may be regulatory reasons they can‚Äôt be sold, it‚Äôs just too hard to make, the timing isn‚Äôt right, etc.The human side of this as well is that according to Vannevar Bush, ‚Äúan invention has the characteristics of a poem. An inventor invents because he cannot help it.‚Äù I can relate with this in some ways, as I am compelled to write this.When it WorksSometimes it works. Maybe 1 out of 100 ideas, you feel incredible conviction in one and it is received by people in the market well. The universe is on your side. A lollapalooza event in the eyes of Munger. While it is just a hint at what‚Äôs possible, and there will be an incredible amount of work from there, you have to imagine all of the possibilities and continue forward.You have to be optimistic close to the point of delusion, because the calculus still doesn‚Äôt make sense. And most people don‚Äôt have this mindset, so you also have to receive their feedback but insulate your delusional optimism to keep pushing forward. There is an S-curve of technological adoption and most will not believe or see what you see until it literally punches them in the face.Startup Risk/Reward CalculusYou should still be logical about ways in which the plan will not work, but you have to leave a lot of room for ‚Äúfiguring things out.‚Äù Most people won‚Äôt be comfortable with that, but that is simply the nature of these things.You need to manufacture serendipity. You have to just keep moving and trying a ton of different things. You should speak to hundreds of people. You never know what these conversations lead to and often they hold keys to doors, step functions, and opportunities there is simply no way to know exist at the beginning. As a plus, those relationships will mean you have someone to ask questions in their field of view at later times.You need to obsess over a singular problem and learn everything you can that surrounds it. Once you map out the surrounding territory of the idea and chew on the problem relentlessly, your brain intuitively forms more idea strands to pull on. Some of which will hold answers.In this sense, a lot of the requisites for figuring it out is simply to stay alive, just so you can continue moving, learning, and figuring it out.Staying AliveJust stay alive. This is actually somewhat how I feel about life too. Most people get on these treadmills and humans will always want more. You should be pretty protective of what you chase.Most of life is just staying alive. Every day above ground is a good day.Low ExpectationsThis is going to sound stupid and irrational, because it is, but I feel I have already accomplished all that I want in life. As completely stupid as that is, I have felt that way every single year for the last 10 years, since my first semester of high school. Some recent examples:After starting Quant, I felt incredible pride that I helped so many students learn about a new career path / connected people to dream jobs and that it may have really helped people in this world.After getting an IB internship, I felt that I had done so much more than I ever thought possible. At best, I figured I could become a mediocre accountant.After working on Nephra, I felt that it was really the most impactful thing I could have done at that time, and that we were solving an important problem no one else cared to glance at.After joining Shaper Capital, I was working on the exact thing that I wanted to with the exact people I wanted to.But that doesn‚Äôt give me a feeling of comfort, stagnation, and riding off into the sunset. It gives me the freedom to continue going all-in. I‚Äôm still playing on house money.It probably also has something to do with the way I was raised. I was never pushed to do anything. I chose to do well in school and push myself. I chose everything I pursued and never had looming expectations of what I ‚Äúshould'' do over my shoulder. I saw in college that many people sputtered out. They were now free from their parents‚Äô authority. Good grades was what their parents wanted, not them. Either that or their parents‚Äô authority was burnt into their brains. They were simply getting good grades because that was all they ever knew to do. Never questioning what it led to.If you‚Äôre going to last the distance, you probably need to be doing what you believe in. This mindset of freedom has enabled me to pursue ambitions that are completely irrational, but why not try?Downside RiskPeople also overestimate downside risk.Especially in my case. There is value in being young and nameless. Worst scenario is you lose a few pennies and learn a ton.I guess another reason that maybe enables risk is viewing money as a means not an end.Try and Fail. Don‚Äôt Fail to Try.That is not to say that someone should take risks and half-heartedly jump in because there is a life preserver nearby. If you do this, you are setting yourself up for failure. You should Try and Fail. But not Fail to Try. Failure is a good thing and teaches.When you make the decision to try, you should immediately close your ears to everything around you. You need to burn the boats. Any hesitation in the face of action is counterproductive.An additional reason startups shouldn‚Äôt view risk the same way investors should is they have the advantage of raw, animalistic ambition. Humans, throughout history, have done miraculous feats with impending doom. Startups are default dead. In a sense, you can back yourself into a corner and trust you can find a solution.In fact, I don‚Äôt really think startups work any other way. As soon as you remove the pain, you are removing that raw horsepower in the early days.A PlanEven with ambiguity, the most important point in all of this is that you need a plan and clear guiding vision.Without a plan, you are a captain lost at sea and wandering aimlessly. If you don‚Äôt set your sights on a clear target, you will obviously not hit it.If the vision was clear, someone would have already done it, however, so you need to leave room for wandering.The plan should be simple and you can alter it as you learn more information. A bad plan is still better than no plan.Your Own PathIf you are on a clear path, it is probably true that it‚Äôs not your path.That is the most uncomfortable thing about all of it. If you are trying to be the next Microsoft, you are partly not learning from Microsoft. You can borrow inspiration from all existing forces in the world, but ultimately you will never do anything remarkable on the trodden path.ConclusionHumans aren‚Äôt great at gauging risk. You can only calculate risk reliably if you are doing something clear, likely, and determinate. However, anything leading to excellence will not come with an instruction manual.Sometimes, you should trust your raw human instinct and that your beliefs and convictions hold value in a world of people doing likely things.Men with a clear vision can move mountains. Ignore false risk. Burn the boats. Make it happen.",No date
Information Theory of Startups,https://jonathanpolitzki.substack.com/p/information-theory-of-startups,"Information TheoryAround 1 year ago today, I was readingThe Art of Doing Science and Engineering, by Richard Hamming, a UIUC and Bell Labs alum. The book dives into a concept pioneered by engineer Claude Shannon called Information Theory. After I read it, I couldn‚Äôt help but think that this framework applies to nearly every aspect of human life.The basic intuition behind information theory is thatunlikely information is much more valuable than likely information. A very simple concept, yet so much of society is built around doing likely things. There are two separate frameworks for this tug-of-war. We will discuss both.Likely ThingsMost things in our world are likely things. When you go through high school, you are participating in a structured curriculum that all those around you are. When you attend college, you are given more freedom, but ultimately you are navigating existing dogma. When you join a company, you are joining an ongoing concern. However, there was a point in recent history where each of these curriculums and processes were mapped out on a white sheet of paper for the first time.For the most part, likely things are extremely valuable. Especially if they have remained likely things for long periods of time. For instance, financial institutions, restaurants, and cemeteries have been around for a very long time. There is consistent value in them, and thus they persist.Unlikely ThingsThere is value in doing unlikely things that are both novel and valuable. Creating new things. Combining existing things in novel ways. Creating a novel signal that prunes (disrupts) existing systems. Etc. Unlikely things that are valuable are equivalent to going from 0-1.In this sense, inventions are underappreciated. It‚Äôs not easily apparent just how much work went intoeverythingaround us. The chair you sit on, the pen you‚Äôre writing with, and every single component that makes up the iPhone. These seem like small creations, but now our world is built upon their foundation.The counter-argument to this is that it doesn‚Äôt matter much who invented things initially, problems are apparent themselves, and it is clear someone will capitalize on them, but it requires the skills, intelligence, and institutional backing to do so. Going 1-n could very well be more important.1-nA passage fromPieces of the Action,by Vannevar Bush.What is more valuable? The initial invention or the following work done to bring something into reality?I don‚Äôt know, and the answer is probably complicated and contextually dependent. However, I am personally not interested in doing things that others can do, and frankly, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm that good at them. It‚Äôs probably a different skill set. You kind of get hit with that reality in investment banking. You work hard and excel for a decade to get a good job, then you find there are others who are still much better than you. Further, the best analysts are themselves commodities. You almost can‚Äôt win. Even if you do win and ‚Äúmake it,‚Äù what is it you‚Äôve actually won?From a young age, I remember not having any interest in doing things that other people could do or were better than me at. It may be the logical and rational decision to do so, but not all of my decisions are made with logic and reason. In high school, my guiding quote was Robert Frost‚Äôs, and it seems to still be.‚ÄúTwo roads diverged in a wood, and I‚ÄîI took the one less traveled by,And that has made all the difference.Time ChangesIn the dark ages, there probably wasn‚Äôt too much value in doing new things. There may have even been too much innovation at certain points in history and not enough people commercializing them.Today and in the future, the surface area of the fractal of new technology grows at an unprecedented pace. We should plan for a large number of previously unsolvable problems to present themselves as new opportunities in the years to come. Since humans don‚Äôt understand exponential growth well, my bet is that we will be perpetually lagging in novel, unlikely, and valuable things for the decades to come.As a principled belief, I generally consider the bottleneck of progress to be the people who actually build the damn thing or have the agency to work incredibly hard / focus on solving problems. The initial ramp is the hardest.Of Commodities and MenThe question that I ask myself is what value I provide. I generally consider myself a stupid and unhelpful person of few talents. However, if I connect the dots backwards, I can recognize a pattern of environments where I have done well connecting people, ideas, and capital in new ways. I also really like doing it.While being a Tyro is unhelpful in most scenarios, I think there is value in being young & dumb. You see the world with fresh eyes. I like questioning existing systems.There is a Need for More Unlikely ThingsThere is no value in doing new things for the sake of doing new things, but it is my observation that the vast majority of people in the world are not doing new things. And some of the people I saw doing new things in school and SF were seemingly doing new things because they like the idea of doing new things.‚ÄúAt a time when the growth of useful knowledge is expanding exponentially, which leads to increased opportunities for growth, society has bred citizens who aren‚Äôt irreverent or hard working enough to pursue them.‚Äù -yes, i'm quoting myselfEven in silicon valley, there aren‚Äôt enough people doing that much new stuff. Humans are the most sheep-like, domesticated animal of them all. There are more problems that need to be solved than people to solve them at this moment. Many of the AI companies are solving the same exact problem.The observation I also had from UIUC is that many students were chomping at the bit to join exciting ‚Äúnew‚Äù things, but most people don‚Äôt themselves start them. If that is the case, it feels like my moral obligation to tackle the initial curve of hard problems. Vannevar Bush highlights the need for far-seeing and energetic individuals in advancing technological progress.VisionRichard Hamming remarks two quotes in the book that effectively say the same thing on the topic of ‚Äúyour research‚Äù. I believe having a clear, novel, useful, and determinate vision is of the utmost importance in my life.‚ÄúHaving a vision is what separates the leaders and the followers.‚Äù‚ÄúIt is well known the drunken sailor who staggers to the left or right with n independent random steps will, on the average, end up about ‚àön steps from the origin. But if there is a pretty girl in one direction, then his steps will tend to go in that direction and he will go a distance proportional to n. In a lifetime of many, many independent choices, small and large, a career with a vision will get you a distance proportional to n, while no vision will get you only the distance ‚àön. In a sense, the main difference between those who go far and those who do not is some people have a vision and the others do not and therefore can only react to the current events as they happen.‚Äù(a somewhat crude example but I‚Äôm with it)Conclusion‚ÄîWhere frameworks diverge‚ÄîDoing likely and unlikely things contribute different forms of value to society. I simply believe that my nature is that of someone who does unlikely things.The counter-argument I have is that at nearly every instance in my life where I have itched to depart the trodden path (not go to college, not start a job, etc), there has been a single person to suggest I didn‚Äôt know all I thought I did. While there is no way to run the experiment again, they were probably right. At some point, however, you need to change the independent variable and see what happens.More importantly, there is an instinctual aspect of human nature where men are supposed to wander into the unknown, burn the boats, work on important problems that no one else is, accept failure as the likely outcome, yet strive for excellence regardless. Failure guides, teaches, and sharpens us. We are supposed to do the hard thingexactly because it is hard.",No date
Project Delta (‚àÜ),https://jonathanpolitzki.substack.com/p/project-delta,"NOTICE: This is an incomplete version that will be refined after further experimentation.Github Repository‚ÄúTo know thyself is the beginning of wisdom.‚Äù - SocratesYeah, yeah, this dead horse has been beaten by every philosopher. I‚Äôve been thinking about technology and how we can use it to solve this problem at last.While it sometimes feels that the explosion in LLMs is overblown, the underlying math & engineering really is a spectacular discovery that enables us to rethink how we interact with and learn from our text.InProject Delta (‚àÜ),I propose a new method to use our data (specifically long-form writing) to extract our ‚Äúideological fingerprint‚Äù that maps a writer‚Äôs beliefs, values, and interests in feature space, and ultimately benchmarks them against others. If each human had an operating system and code base, what would it look like? Maybe we can use our data to map it out.The implications of this are significant. The first step to solve any problem is to define it. Most people haven‚Äôt even defined themselves, restricting the way in which they wander through life. I imagine a world where people know their convictions, beliefs, values, and how they line up against others, so we can start having real conversations about progress.Knowing Yourself is Oddly DifficultEveryone is trying to know themselves. People go to psychiatrists, girls read you by your horoscope, employees seek to understand their strengths and weaknesses. Artists find their voice. It seems true that understanding yourself is a useful endeavor. It‚Äôs helpful to understand your limitations in order to avoid them and your strengths to use them. It‚Äôs helpful to act objectively and to detect personal biases. It is valuable to understand your beliefs/interests and how they differ to others, to properly frame how you see the world. It‚Äôs also valuable to benchmark your beliefs against others to call into question your assumptions. Should you entertain the possibility that the world isn‚Äôt flat?But for some reason, it is incredibly difficult to know yourself. It sometimes feels like the people around me understand my personality better than I do. Perhaps it‚Äôs because I live in my own head. I could not possibly understand what is going on in the head of the short and square businessman sitting next to me on the bus, or unwrap their conscious and unconscious beliefs. Even if I could, this would then just present a sample size of n=2, which is entirely unrepresentative of the global population N=7,951,000,000.Bottom Line: Knowing yourself is an important problem, but it is very difficult to do. Today‚Äôs tools to benchmark our personality, ideas, interests and beliefs are nonexistent to poor at best.Personality TestsThe closest thing I can think of are personality tests such as Enneagram or Big 5, which are broad attempts to categorize individuals in different buckets. Often, these tests are taken with multiple choice. They are more of an If-Then statement than anything else. But of course, humans are much too nuanced to be bucketed in such ways.This fellow JP feels the same way.We Can Do BetterThis sucks. These categories are only2-dimensional. In reality, they should ben-dimensionaland influence one another better than the current research does. If you wrote a book on your life, what would be in it? What texture would the language take?I came across thisprojecta Computer + Cognitive Sciences student at Berkeley named Sarvasv Kulpati put together, in which he explores the hypothesis:can we detect writers from just their progression through LLM latent space?This is an interesting question. Does our writing style distinguish ourselves the same way in which we have ‚Äúfingerprints?‚Äù He experiments with the way a writer ‚Äústumbles through feature space‚Äù and charts out the below 3 authors‚Äô journeys relative to baseline. He doesn‚Äôt quite explore what the variance here implies with each author, but I do believe there is more to be done with this work.It does appear that each writer has their own ‚Äúshape.‚Äù We will return to this point.Why This is Really ImportantIf it is true that each writer‚Äôs language takes its own shape, perhaps we can begin to learn more about the writer from their fingerprint. I‚Äôm not talking about their grammar. I‚Äôm talking about the essence of who they are as a person. I‚Äôm constantly drowning in thought trying to understand myself and how I differ from others. Of course, no one can answer this question. Existingsolutions, shrinks and tests, suck.DISRUPTING THE PSYCHIC MARKET!!!!!!Most of the use of LLMs today really just answers questions as a highly intelligent form of word guessing. There may be a way to use the underlying machinery to actually map out ideas (more on this later).Some Questions This Tool Could AnswerAnswer the question, ‚Äúwho am I?‚ÄùWhat if you could map out an entire person‚Äôs personality, beliefs, and interests from the cues left in their writing?What if you could quantify and plot ideas throughout history (the ‚ÄúGoogle Trends‚Äù of history)? Plot the zeitgeist of history.What if you could detect points of inflection in your own life in your writing, where certain events or experience triggered new understandings and beliefs that altered the course of your life.[1] Other potential use applications in the appendix.This ProjectWe will take this project through 4 or 5 steps. It doesn‚Äôt escape me that this will be an extremely heavy lift for me given my amateur coding skills.(1) map next word prediction against baseline(2) vectorize and map text in an n-dimensional space(3) identify patterns in ‚Äúidea space‚Äù and abstract clouds of vectorized words in close proximity(4) benchmark results. After the text has been vectorized, vectorize a benchmark of text or word progression. What are the different shapes that the text takes, and how do they differ?(5) [Maybe] productize this software(1) map next word prediction against baselineI‚Äôd like to replicate Sarvasv‚Äôs work to compare my writing to the ‚Äúaverage,‚Äù (actual sequence vs most likely). So the following:Ingest and scrub my data, first focusing on files I have downloaded from substack.Replicate the experiment for multiple new.Loop through every word in the sentence, getting the hidden state vector of 0 to n-1 passed into the modelPerform PCA on the features, and then use the axes with the most variance to plot the pointsUseMicrosoft Phi-2, it seemed like a pretty powerful base modelAfter the base experiment, try this with multiple essays and compare results.(2) vectorize and map text in an n-dimensional spaceOnce we‚Äôve made it this far, I‚Äôd like to once again take my text and this time vectorize the whole damn thing.Example image from thisoverviewfrom 3Blue1Brown (the best I‚Äôve seen yet).Question: do I need to tokenize the words for this exercise?(3) identify patterns in ‚Äúidea space‚Äù and abstract clouds of vectorized words in close proximityThere will be certain clustering of vectors. I‚Äôd like to repeat the structure of the experiment in [1] with [2] and map out the vectors in latent space. It may be difficult to visualize. We aren‚Äôt dealing in 3 dimensions here. I‚Äôll have to figure out the best way to go about this. Probably by finding the minimum difference between groups of terms. Or the aggregateDelta ‚àÜ.(4) benchmark results. After the text has been vectorized, vectorize a benchmark of text or word progression. What are the different shapes that the text takes, and how do they differ?After you have mapped your ideas in visual space, can you benchmark them against other people or even the ‚Äúaverage‚Äù of ideas?Questions:Are there any established methods for mapping out abstract thoughts in latent space?Are there any researchers working on this? Will this be incredibly difficult?How much text will I need to do this? Will I need to use authored text with significant writings on particular topics as a proof of concept?Extra Credit:Can you plot ideas throughout time? Can you capture the zeitgeist of history and see how ideas have changed.A friend of mine sent across thisHouse of Commons Hansard archiveof debates between 1803-2005. What is interesting here is it offers a logged, structured forum for seeing how ideas and beliefs have changed over the years in a tug-of-war.Literature ReviewWriter Detection LLM - SarvasvAppendix[1] Use CasesBroad problem: People have difficulty understanding themselves. Generally, how are you as a human unique?Writing editing (beyond grammar, beyond structure) of the root of the ideas in the textTherapy or Psychiatry, unpacking your thoughts and laying them out for psychoanalysis either by the computer, you, or the human profession. Writing therapy. Write about your problems. Computer helps you understand and solve them.General tool to unpack ideas within a piece of writingMy personal use case: I have my own thoughts on a variety of topics in a vacuum (my own head) that I believe to be true.If there are generally accepted arguments against them, I would like to understand them and decide whether to adopt them.I think there is a ton of value in realizing an idea or belief you have that others don‚Äôt is both unique and correct. These are the ideas that shape the world. This is essentially all scientists, philosophers, etc. have done throughout history.Research papers all introduce a problem by examining existing ideas, studies, and findings that have been determined, in order to build upon them.An AI agent that self-plays with ideas can come up with breakthroughs by itself.This type of agent could in theory produce its own data and continuously improve.Substack‚Äôs vision is to build a new economic engine for culture. I think they would acquire something like this.Summarize your own mind and digital footprint. Who are you?Track your data over time. See how your beliefs, health data, etc. have changed. What were major inflection points in your life.Identify your cultural traits. Which company shares them most? Which city shares them most? Which group of people shares them most? Which religion shares them most? Where do you belong?Maybe deviation from average isn‚Äôt the goal. Can you compare yourself to certain minds throughout history? I.e. you seem to mostly believe this. Abraham Lincoln would have agreed with you on this but disagreed on this (based on his written history).We may now actually be able to capture the zeitgeist of history? What beliefs have emerged recently? Can we then evaluate the ones that are temporary and the ones that will stay?[2] Your Personal DataFor years, big tech has had a better understanding of us than we have had of ourselves. You‚Äôve heard the stories of the woman who started getting targeted motherhood ads from Target before she knew she was pregnant. You‚Äôve probably even noticed advertisements come up on your phone for products that you had in the back of your mind. Your data is deep and very telling.Some sources for personal data that I have been thinking about for the use of this project. I‚Äôm going to start out with my substack data because the information is the most substantive and representative of my own walk through interests, beliefs, values, etc. It is the best logged digital footprint of me. Twitter probably has too many liked dog videos, but it is a close second.",No date
Culture,https://jonathanpolitzki.substack.com/p/culture,"In 2019, I thought culture was pi√±atas, Sauerkraut, football Sundays, and Christmas. Some ritual thing people do for whatever reason that didn‚Äôt interest me.In 2020, I thought culture was what Deloitte and Protiviti would present to kids on campus, ping pong tables in the office and maybe one day even a high-5 from your boss.In 2021, I thought about the differences between the other students on campus and I. I started thinking about my own values and beliefs, and how it was different from others. I had always had these beliefs, but for some reason as a kid you don‚Äôt really understand differences in people, and that you can be both different and have merit.In 2022, I started drafting up my visions for culture for 2 startups I was building on campus. From this experimentation, I was able to see what worked and what didn‚Äôt.In 2023, I was working my first big boy job. I had now felt the full force of culture and how it would impact every second of every day and how I made decisions and behaved amongst the group.In 2024, I work both at Shaper Capital (parent company) and with separate portfolio companies, observing and realizing that every company culture is different and it‚Äôs not something that is easily changed. I came to the understanding that culture is the set of behaviors, principles, values, and understanding that act as a backdrop to every decision that has been and will be made at the company.‚ÄîCulture is ImportantIf I plot these annual points, I realize that where I once believed culture was a trivial aspect of a business, I now believeculture is the most important part of a company. It feels hard to even just call it a ‚Äúpart‚Äù of a company, because culture is the company and the company is the culture bottled into a solidified institution. I will likely be even more focused on culture the more I understand it.Before you work in a company, or start one, you likely have an abstract idea of what a company is. When you think of Nike, you probably just have some idea of their brand and the products they provide to the world.After you spend time with companies and look real close at them, you start to realize that, yes, companies are vehicles for providing value to the world, but some imperfect human being created that company and its process. Moreover, every new product, decision to enter a new market, design choice, quality issue, and happy hour are a product of the decisions and behavior of the company‚Äôs people and processes. Companies are organisms that live, breathe, adapt, mutate, and die just as their cells (employees) and organs (departments and teams).My observations on culture from both the perspective of the company and the employee. Ideally, I will also start to define some sort of framework on my own beliefs for what a ‚Äúgood‚Äù culture looks like.What is Culture?We should properly define culture if we are going to ascribe so much importance to it. Culture, while a fuzzy concept, is defined by Joel Mokyr inA Culture of Growth as the below:‚ÄúCulture is a set of beliefs, values, and preferences, capable of affecting behavior, that are socially (not genetically) transmitted and that are shared by some subset of society.‚ÄùHe also describes the following terms:Beliefs: statements of factual nature to the state of the worldValues: statements about society and social relations (often thought about as ethics and ideology)Preferences: statements about individual affairs such as consumption and personal affairsIndividual CultureIndividualismIf you introspect, you have a set of beliefs, values, and preferences that you may have had a predisposition for genetically, were transferred vertically from your parents, and learned from a variety of experiences/data points throughout your life, but mostly picked up through imitation and choice of a menu from the people you were surrounded by. Humans are sheep. Your unique combination of beliefs, values, and preferences are now deeply embedded in your personality. Some of these can be changed and influenced, others are much harder to. Depending on the age, plasticity of the individual‚Äôs brain, openness to new ideas, agreeableness, interest, etc.My framework for this, as referenced in my last essay, is that (1) we develop an idea of what the world is and how it functions from an objective standpoint, (2) we create meaning from this into our beliefs, values, and preferences, and (3) ultimately act in accordance with those beliefs.Your ‚ÄúWhy‚ÄùThroughout your life, you have probably gravitated towards different ideas and different groups of thought. You may have found that some activities never made sense to you the same way they made sense to others. You may have found that in some environments you thrived and some environments you struggled. Some cultures are painful as you are forced to act in ways that go against the grain of your individual belief system and some feel as natural as breathing. You should always try to be in the latter culture.My observation through high school, the University of Illinois, and even now is that a surprisingly small % of people are truly intrinsically motivated and beat to their own drum. Of this population, the smaller yet % of the population has a ‚Äúwhy‚Äù that intersects with yours, you get along with, and has the necessary skills to actually accomplish what you want to accomplish.Those people would be interested in a topic even if you didn‚Äôt force them to be. They have a ‚Äúwhy‚Äù, a purpose, a sparkle in the eye. They know why they are speaking with you. They are excited by a blank sheet of paper and by the prospect of filling it with ideas. They have a north star and their natural state is progressing towards it.These people don‚Äôt need micromanaging. They understand the broader direction of their life, why what you are working on is important in that light, how to accomplish it, and what that means for what they should be spending their time on at any moment. This person is aligned.My personal view is if I have enough money to be comfortable, my own internal test is that I want to be doing what I would be doing as if money didn‚Äôt matter, because it doesn‚Äôt.More specifically, this probably means growth and that usually comes from being all-in working on important problems with smart people I admire. Any other combination of variables means my function for growth/time is not optimized. This is also why I feel the value of colleges is not only the content of the courses. The majority of the value of colleges is being surrounded by the smartest people of diverse belief systems so that you pick up their traits and learn from them, subjecting yourself to purposeful mimeticism.My function for growth is inwardly focused, rather than an accumulation of material things or money. I would make the bet that if you want to make a lot of money, your function should still be inwardly optimized. The best way to make a million dollars is to become the type of person who can make a million dollars.VariationThat is just my view of individual culture. Different systems will work for different people and different problems. Some thrive in a different environment. I used to wonder why people work jobs that pay well but people don‚Äôt like to do them. They disconnect their intrinsic motivation from work. They understand the transaction they are making. They give up their time and receive money in return. Many big law / finance professionals leave their life at the door when they clock in. There are exceptional people of all shapes, sizes, and motivations. The problem doesn‚Äôt arise when you have different cultures, it‚Äôs when you have people working in the wrong workplace culture. Anything forced is suboptimal.Exceptional People & AptitudeUltimately, it is not enough to just believe and work hard. While that is probably the most important part, there is a very real sense that aptitude matters. Can you actually build the damn thing? Do you have the experience and intelligence to arrive at the right solution?It is also true that exceptionalism breeds exceptionalism. Iron sharpens iron. There is this phrase that‚Äôs used, cultural density, that I like. The idea that there are people who can provide 50x the value of an average person is used inThe Datavant Wayand that with that in mind it‚Äôs not a problem to pay them more. Exceptionalism spreads slowly and mediocrity spreads quickly. You notice that in startups as soon as you lose momentum it is hard to pick it back up.When I foundedQuant, this was something that intuitively made sense to me. The power law of talent, that the top 1-5 students in algorithmic trading / quantitative finance from each university could drive significantly higher returns than the top 30 from UIUC. Smart and ambitious people also like working with other smart and ambitious people, you just need to connect them and direct them towards an important goal.It is possible that the last real alpha left is in finding exceptional people as human focus is the most valuable commodity on planet earth.A question of what is more important, culture or talent, is hard to answer. What is more important, attitude or aptitude? Can you have a good culture with bad people? Can you have a bad culture with good people? My guess is that attitude is more important, my life is just a giant bet that grit and determination are more valuable than intelligence, but of course you need both.InstitutionsCultural VehiclesOne person working alone aligns with their individual culture. As you begin grouping people together to function, you are creating a cultural institution. Within the category of institutions, I will focus specifically on companies.Companies are necessary vehicles of change. You cannot often create sufficient change alone. You cannot be successful in a vacuum. You need other people rowing in the same direction as you. You can‚Äôt all be rowing in separate directions, as you will then never arrive anywhere meaningful. As Mokyr puts it,‚ÄúAt some level, all evolutionary and cultural systems must have such a system in place, to lend some modicum of stability to existing beliefs and prevent complete chaos.‚ÄùFrom my observation, this is a direct parallel to how a company scales. Often, when starting a company, you are doingsomething that doesn't scale. Then, you need to put in place processes and rules to make a machine that scales. You lose the beauty and nuance of the initial product but it allows you to create a repeatable product and process. Think customized research for a client to creating art. You can‚Äôt really do these things at scale. Starting companies isn‚Äôt actually that hard, it‚Äôs building the culture and lean mechanical processes that‚Äôs hard.Two people combine their cultural values, beliefs, and perspectives to work on something. There is inevitably conflict and misalignment in these as two sets of beliefs are never the same. Add a third, and you again will need to make rational choices and forge social contracts on how you will behave. People will make sacrifices. There is a healthy amount of conflict. If you add someone with too many different beliefs, they will be rejected by the system, be influenced, or be forced to integrate.Setting CultureIt is really difficult to set a culture from the top down because it is really the combination of beliefs, values, preferences that the institution aligns and agrees upon. It does feel like there needs to be someone who sets and protects the company culture. I sometimes feel like that is the most important job of the CEO.Reflexivity & CultsThere is a curious nature of these organizations as they become a living, breathing organism. They have a reflexive nature where the culture influences the institution and the institution in turn influences the culture. As institutions grow mature, they lose their flexibility and the culture becomes more entrenched, which is good for stability at the detriment of agility. It doesn‚Äôt matter what executive changes Coca-Cola puts in place. Their complex web of incentives, hierarchy, goals, and international stake is extremely difficult to untangle.Humans have some imitative qualities that make it really hard to go against the grain. We also have instincts that make it difficult to challenge authority. I struggle with this and it makes me avoidant. It makes perfect sense, if you challenged authority for much of history and popped your head above the crowd, you would have had it chopped off.I wrote about (cult)ure in 2022 in my essay ‚ÄúA Year of Startups.‚Äù I noticed two things:People have a natural tendency to look to the leader / point of authority. You also notice this trickle-down effect in meetings. As a leader, you must carefully exercise when you speak and what you say as it will have a lot of collateral effects. I‚Äôve noticed some leaders purposely refrain, which forces independent thought, and this seems super effective.‚ÄúI‚Äôll start this section by saying the most surprising thing about starting these organizations was the fact that people kept looking to me for what to do. I‚Äôm an idiot, what do I know? You start seeing that what you say in meetings rubs off on people and hear them recite them in conversations with another person. It‚Äôs still really odd to me, but it does make sense. People join because they are often excited about what you are building. They don‚Äôt know the full story and look to the builder for guidance. Over time, this process becomes more natural and a corporate culture begins to develop.‚ÄùWhen you create a company, you want the culture to be insulated. I firmly believe that any company I start, we will spend all our time together IN PERSON. I don‚Äôt think anyone could sway my opinion on this. You need to maintain cohesion and there is a strong sense of community and trust you get from working together.‚ÄúMaintaining that cohesion and focus within a group is vital. Concentrating that focus in one space prevents leakage when members wander into the dilutive atmosphere that is daily life, which has too many distracting moving parts and a disorderly focus on the ‚Äòdaily thing.‚Äô‚ÄùIncentivesOften the nuts and bolts that keep things stable in institutions are its incentive systems. You need someone to lead the product and specifically assign them a few KPIs such as user engagement to accomplish. With this North Star/Endpoint, the employee works backwards to meet it. You may have structured compensation and feedback on this goal. Incentives are what ultimately determine a person‚Äôs actions, despite what they may say. It is human nature. If incentives are improperly set, they can create deviant behavior that is not beneficial for the system.Consider the paperclip AI problem:‚ÄúPhilosophers have speculated that an AI tasked with a task such as creating paperclips might cause an apocalypse by learning to divert ever-increasing resources to the task, and then learning how to resist our attempts to turn it off.‚ÄùThe fear here is that the simple incentive to create paperclips may set off a change of events that ultimately engulfs the entire universe.Cultural ChangeMarketplace of Ideas and Cultural EvolutionIn the exploration of what caused the Industrial Revolution, Joel Mokyr discusses how culture changes. This is somewhat difficult to quantify, but two models are referenced for how cultural change occurs, the Evolutionary Model of ideas, the Marketplace of Ideas and the Choice-Based Cultural Model.It is the least likely that cultural changes are just genetic, it is also unlikely that culture is only passed down from your parents vertically. It is more likely that throughout life we are presented with a marketplace of ideas, in other words a cultural menu, that we choose from. This enables faster transmission of ideas.I‚Äôve also written before about the systems and moral structures that exist are the systems that win and persist. The rules and history is written by the victors. For instance, while communism always seems to present itself as an attractive option on the cultural menu to the majority, it just doesn‚Äôt fare that well in the face of evolution.BiasesThe effect of ‚Äúbiases‚Äù determines how likely an individual is to adopt a belief, value, or preference. How convincing is it? How much do you want to believe it? People sometimes just believe what they want to believe.If you think about society today, a significant amount of change occurs through the rapid information transmission that occurs through social media, the news, and influencers. In China, coercion bias may be more relevant.Fortunately as well, we live in a time that adopts belief based on empirical evidence. Obviously not always but more than in the past.Content-Based Bias: Which seems to be best supported by evidence?Direct Bias: Society appoints points of authority who pick the ideas.Consistency + Confirmation Bias: People choose values that are consistent or aligned with existing beliefs. If you believe the Earth is flat, you will have more difficulty accepting heliocentrism.Model-Based Bias: People imitate role models.Rhetorical Bias: Some charismatic people are simply better at persuading the crowd.Frequency Dependent Bias: People believe what the majority of people around them believe.Rationalization Bias: Culture is changed or maintained by the institutions. I.e. the church calling something a sin or a University taking a stance on a topic.Coercion Bias: Cultural beliefs are affected by force.Salient Event Bias: highly traumatic events lead the population to take a stance. I.e. global financial crisis and the public‚Äôs view on regulating Wall Street.Cultural EntrepreneursSociety also sometimes has instances where a single figure‚Äôs stance. The importance of cultural entrepreneurs is debated. Would the change have happened without their agency? Maybe, but there seems to be some role.To me, this is Balaji in Network States. Peter Thiel for the idea that every great company happens once. They likely have done some form of repackaging but it still draws attention to the idea.Note that there is statistically significant evidence that the majority of cultural change comes from the small minority in the elite.Fragmentation & CompetitionSome environments are more conducive to competition of ideas. Are the powers-that-be more fragmented and forced to compete with different ideas.Changing Company CultureI have seen 4 separate takes on changing culture after the fact.Break and Reorder: It is possible to take a company, break it, and reorder it, while cultivating true internal believers to set sail in a new direction. I wouldn‚Äôt have thought so before. In retrospect, there is probably a set of boxes that need to be checked to make sure this arrangement would work, are you aligned?Healthy Conflict: There is a healthy amount of conflict in company culture. In other words, it is a feature, not a bug, that people push and pull on issues. This tug-of-war causes people to truly assess multiple perspectives and through healthy discussion arrive at the best decision, rather than falling into a local maxima.Separate Cultures: Creating separate cultures and organizations that operate relatively independently within a larger institution. You can also cross-pollinate by adding a few high-level people to both sides.Thiel‚Äôs law: A startup messed up at its foundation cannot be fixed. There is a very real aspect that I have seen in some people where you can simply not change them or they fail to adapt. Not only this, but as a company reaches maturity, the incentives and processes are so deeply embedded that they may not be able to change.Culture of GrowthHistoricalThere was a major shift that occurred between 1500-1700 that put the world on a course it would never return from via the Industrial Revolution. The book makes the argument that boils the change down into the growth of useful knowledge and a shift in Attitude accompanied by Aptitude of the populace.Bacon presented the belief that useful knowledge can have an impact on growth. Then, Newton proved it through his work. Society became believers in technological progress. Ultimately, the church and luddism lost the fight. Society now believed technological progress to be booth possible andgood.I think we are seeing a projection of this trend in recent years with the e/acc movement that technological progress is not just good butmoral and necessary. Elon Musk presents his grabs for power and fame with the face that they are good for humanity.Company Growth TraitsYou should assume that there are an infinite combination of beliefs and values that a company can present. Each combination is right for different industries and strategies. There is no perfect formula. Ideally a company strategy is designed to maximize profits. It will need to organize itself in a way that optimizes for attracting talent, builds a great product, learns a lot of useful information, and can tell a lot of people about its product.What traits are these exactly?There will be a lot here, but some of the traits that are listed in the book are:Trust - Do you have trust that others are acting in your best interest?Alignment - are you rowing in the same direction? (agree to disagree and commit)Individualism over Collectivism & Property Rights - Are you rewarded for your workEgalitarian - Are there equal opportunities for all?Meritocratic - (is the best output rewarded)Growth is possible and good - Attitude and belief (necessary optimism)Industriousness - Do people work really hardEnforceable contracts - Are the rules clear and enforcedLow rate of rent seeking - Low bureaucracy and politicsUseful knowledge - learning leads to useful knowledge which leads to growth and also should be considered an investment in human capitalTime preference and delayed gratification - do you have the capacity for patient investments into the futureRisk - do you encourage risk-taking behavior?Irreverence - do you go against the authorityIrreverence is the most difficult one, but seems to be highlighted by Mokyr theA Culture of Growthas one of the most important aspects of innovation. You need to have some sort of distrust in the system. I‚Äôll dig more into this in the next section.I would be really interested in plotting the above points starting in 1400 to today. Growth in useful knowledge has gone through the roof. Trust has largely increased. Time preference seems to not have changed much due to consumerism. Irreverence is completely restrained. There is significant rent-seeking behavior. People really don‚Äôt work that hard on average. More people believe in the future but notthatmany. Society is relatively meritocratic but on misaligned incentives such as test scores that determine the future of our children. And we aren‚Äôt aligned on any common goals for the future. We are also highly individualist. Egalitarianism is relatively good but those from poor socioeconomic backgrounds are extremely disadvantaged.At a time when the growth of useful knowledge is expanding exponentially, which leads to increased opportunities for growth, society has bred citizens who aren‚Äôt irreverent or hard working enough to pursue them.A uniquely good culture of growth, the people who are extremely smart, industrious, trustworthy, irreverent, and believe in technological progress.Perspective of the EmployeeIn addition to making money, many employees want to feel that their work matters. Employees are human beings. We question our purpose on Earth and whether it is worth our time.The leader should always convey benevolence to their employees, even if the pragmatic decisions to build the business are the most important, and the message conveyed is sold or repackaged with a different bias or framing to accomplish what is in the best interest of the company.‚ÄúWhen the general regards his troops as young children, they will advance into the deepest valleys with him. When he regards his troops as his beloved children, they will be willing to die with him.‚Äù - Sun-tzuNapoleon was alongside his troops on the battlefield.In addition to feeling that an employee matters, they should be given the opportunity to grow. Societies that don‚Äôt grow erupt into internal strife. As I mentioned, when I am not able to grow, I become frustrated. The employee will ultimately ask the question ‚Äúwhy am I here?‚Äù They should have a clear answer for this. The manager should regularly check in with the employee to make sure the arrangement is working.The employee should share a common information base, when feasible. Common direction and data makes it easier for the employee to make micro-decisions every day and also feel that they are a part of the overall organization.CompensationNot all compensation is money. How do you encourage and compensate someone who doesn‚Äôt care about money? You will need to pay them in other ways.Irreverence‚ÄúIf the culture is heavily infused with respect and worship of ancient wisdom so that any intellectual innovation is considered deviant and blasphemous, technological creativity will be similarly constrained. irreverence is a key to progress‚ÄùIf I introspect, my strongest character traits (both weaknesses and strengths) are deep irreverence / distrust in current systems coupled with curiosity. The problem is this has never been an asset throughout my life. Any system in which I have partaken has rejected irreverent behavior and I have been extremely disadvantaged. Teachers hated me. I don‚Äôt do well with the process. I can‚Äôt follow instructions. I don‚Äôt care about convention. I don‚Äôt work well under others. The only work that I have excelled at is my own.While this ability to think differently isn‚Äôt rewarded by most institutions, it is rewarded by growth and new opportunity in the frontier, where there are no conventions, there is just open white space.But how do you employ these people? You give them rope, align their incentives, and keep them in check, and get rid of me if I don‚Äôt work out, fair. That‚Äôs the risk of meritocratic, non-beaurocratic institutions. You can grow, but you can also sputter out. I am reminded of one of my favorite Nietzsche quotes:‚Äúwhen young men are ready to be sent out into the ""desert,"" they are instead put into safe bureaucracies. They are ""estranged from themselves"" - the heat of their youth left cold. ""Daily toil"" becomes your opium and your edge is permanently blunted‚Äù.This is what academic and research institutions lost. You can‚Äôt be a mad scientist anymore or you won‚Äôt get funded. Creativity is drained from the youth as soon as they set foot in elementary school.OKRs & GrowthThese seem like an effective way to create clarity around ‚Äúwhat success looks like‚Äù and then for the talented employee to connect the ambiguous dots and back into their end goal using whatever methods that make most sense to them.This allows the individual to grow at their own pace. Compared to traditional companies where you grow at the pace of the linear career path. Even better, in the best company, you grow at your fastest path and when you reach plateaus, your organization helps you break through them.The company can also push the employee as a part of the social contract. Humans are inherently lazy, but we can enter ourselves into difficult things. Men are not afraid of pain, they can endure any suffering for an end they are interested in.Perspective of the CompanyFor the company, it is also in the long-term interest of growth to develop employees internally. But at the end of the day, it is the employer's interest to pay the employee the smallest fee possible to do work.The employer oftentimes knows how they want the work done as well. There is no creativity encouraged because, frankly, it‚Äôs not that helpful.However, if you understand one thing. That thing is that human focus is Earth‚Äôs most valuable commodity. And that focus is best spent on what the person is interested in and has the freedom to pursue, you understand that the major arbitrage opportunity exists in extremely smart intrinsically motivated people who fare well with white space.In a good situation, the employer‚Äôs and employee‚Äôs interests are well balanced into a social contract that is a Win-Win.Some companies are central planning machines (Apple) because they know what must be done and want to do it repeatedly, some are more of a learning machine. There is a balance of libertarianism and authoritarianism you need to strike when creating a company culture to accomplish a certain goal.PoliticsBe wary of rent-seekers and politicians.Culture as an InvestmentCulture is the passive investment vehicle of a leader. Imagine you instill a strong culture and go on vacation for a week. The employees would act as if you were there. Ideally, you could one day depart the company and there would be no problems. This is what happens when you take a step back and build culture from the outset.ConclusionCompany culture is super important.",No date
‚ñ≥ - Everything I Know Now,https://jonathanpolitzki.substack.com/p/everything-i-know-now,"‚ñ≥‚ÄúThere is a concatenation of events in this best of all possible worlds: for if you had not been kicked out of a magnificent castle for love of Miss Cunegonde: if you had not been put into the Inquisition: if you had not walked over America: if you had not stabbed the Baron: if you had not lost all your sheep from the fine country of El Dorado: you would not be here eating preserved citrons and pistachio-nuts.‚Äù‚ÄúAll that is very well,‚Äù answered Candide, ‚Äúbut let us cultivate our garden.‚Äù~ Candide, VoltaireIn the passage, the speaker is suggesting that all of Candide's tragedies were necessary for him to be where he is today, a way of saying that all the events Candide experienced (good or bad) were part of a grand, beneficial plan.On the same plane, in our lives, we can only connect the dots looking backwards. Our fortunes and misfortunes are the gifts and scars of life, and each experience shapes who we are and who we become.While thinking about these things is helpful to plan, I‚Äôve learned we should not over-index on solving for massive abstract hypothetical problems or getting caught up uncovering universal truths. Sometimes all we can do is ‚Äúcultivate our garden,‚Äù focus, grow, ‚ñ≥right here, right now. I‚Äôve provided my personal manual for how to achieve this at the end.Now, with that said, let‚Äôs solve some massive abstract hypothetical problems ‚ÜíIntroductionWriting has become a central and effective tool I‚Äôve adopted over the past two years in navigating my life. It is a way to organize thoughts and forces you to think deeply about assumptions you take as truths. It is also clear to me that sometimes the thing that really matters is knowing which question to ask.In this piece of writing, I summarize essays I‚Äôve written across 2022-2023. From the themes of each essay as individual data points, I connect the dots backwards into a narrative that has become my life philosophy. This writing is summed up into: 1) the importance of a personal belief system 2) growing based on your personal belief system 3) my pragmatic plan to‚ñ≥.What is striking when reflecting upon my views as they have evolved over time is how much they can be tracked to specific instances and experiences I have had in my life, like an asteroid collecting scars and dents via collisions with other objects. In many ways, the human neural net is a loss function that adjusts to our environment and the information we consume, so we should be purposeful about what we ingest.The clearest learnings have been from direct experience absorbing a problem, carrying its burden, chewing on potential solutions for an extended period of time, and finally arriving at my own beliefs from first principles. Humans learn by doing.I‚Äôve also created two new symbols, because I don‚Äôt like the current symbols we use for(1)‚Äúmeaning / purpose‚Äù and(2)‚Äúgrowth, expansion of the self, overcoming, and will to power.‚ÄùThe first set of words are a false symbol and overdetermined, there are no meanings, there just ‚Äúis‚Äù the current state of the world.I think the second set of words are extremely important, because in many ways they are poorly contrived symbols to capture what is the most important theme of this philosophy and what I believe to be the ‚Äúmeaning of life.‚Äù1. ŒõœåŒ≥ŒøœÇ (The Logos)- ‚ÄúA principle originating in classical Greek thought which refers to a universal divine reason, immanent in nature, yet transcending all oppositions and imperfections in the cosmos and humanity.‚Äù I originally read this term in Marcus Aurelius‚ÄôMeditationsand prefer to think of it simply as the current rational and logical state of the universe as a backdrop, and our own personal philosophies that spring from it.2. ‚ñ≥- The hollowed out triangle replaces and combines growth, expansion of the self, irreverence towards current systems, and the requisite focus and suffering. It is also a very important symbol that I‚Äôve thought about for the last decade. It was something that I‚Äôve always known, but couldn‚Äôt quite articulate until now. Notably also the symbol for delta or change. And the symbol for Maslow‚Äôs hierarchy of needs, sacrificing for the sake of achieving self-actualization. How do you pronounce this, you ask? That‚Äôs for you to determine.The LogosI address the plugs we use in our society to provide humans with an answer to a question that doesn‚Äôt exist.‚ÄúWhat is the meaning of life?‚ÄùOr rather‚ÄúWhat is life?‚ÄùOften these plugs come in the form of religion or another proxy. In reality, there is onlyThe Logos.In the same way that people defer to a political party in the place of having their own nuanced views, we defer to these preexisting moral manuals. It is difficult to create meaning and defined behaviors out of an infinite universe of entropy. But we can. And if we can, we should.The first step is to recognize that the existing competing systems are imperfect and set forth by other irrational humans no different than yourself, and that they change over time. You first recognize this so that you can begin to forge your own path and shine a light so bright that the existing systems must recognize it and adopt it. This is how someone shapes the world. There have been millions of systems that have come and gone. The systems that overtake and persist are the systems that‚ñ≥, which is an important point.In order for you to create meaning, you need to step back and analyze the world from first principles. What is right in the world? What is wrong in the world? What is life? When you understand what life is, you can begin to formulate an ideology on how to live it. How to live life is inherently unique to you. If you reject the existing system but don‚Äôt create your own belief system, you are in no-man‚Äôs land. You are a moth without a light. You are a pilot without a map. I will here reference the old chess adage that ‚Äúa bad plan is better than no plan.‚ÄùThis is the most important point so far. Most people don‚Äôt have belief systems and wander through life in a random walk. It is difficult to create your own belief system. But if you don‚Äôt, you are living your life on other people‚Äôs terms. More importantly, if you don‚Äôt have a defined target, you will obviously never hit it.There is also a lot of meaning and leverage in having your own belief system. There is more meaning in things that would not get done ‚Äúbut for‚Äù you. You don‚Äôt want to be the awkward 3rd person carrying a table. In today‚Äôs world where everyone wants the same thing, the competition is simply too fierce to leave you any scraps‚Äìyou don‚Äôt want to be 3rd runner up, you should be the best in the world. Your differences are assets that provide leverage, they are not a liability.‚ñ≥Now that you have developed a personal belief system unique to you and understand that the world is malleable, you can create a plan to exert work and allocate resources over time to‚ñ≥in accordance with your philosophy and actualize your beliefs.Many people say that you should do what you are passionate about or what you are interested in. Some people speak of interests as if they are just something random that you were born with. Others speak of interests as if they don‚Äôt exist and all that exists is discipline and doing the right thing when you should. These were both frustrating responses to me. What am I interested in and why? I don‚Äôt feel like I was arbitrarily assigned with an interest at birth, do you?I contend that interests are not random and are fungibly formed and exchanged as a mechanism for humans to‚ñ≥.Your interests help you solve problems you have or help you understand some form of characterological development unique to you and dependent on your understanding ofThe Logos. As your perspective changes, so too might your interests. This is why you should first have clear beliefs of yourLogos,because it influences interests.In the world we live in today, we are rewarded and punished for our interests in relation to current moral structures and how incentives are outlined. Artists aren‚Äôt rewarded as the capitalists are. These moral structures aren‚Äôt purposeful and there‚Äôs no big man behind the curtain pulling the strings. They are emergent properties of systems that persist. The systems that persist are those that are evolutionarily adapted to‚ñ≥.In some ways, these systems present themselves as obstacles to be surmounted or impenetrable walls equivalent to laws of physics. You need to straddle the line on how you can grow in the world you have been dealt. It is notable that the primary lever of change in modern society has become growth and innovation. Money runs the world and technology changes it.In a world that 1) the meaning of life is to‚ñ≥in accordance with The Logosand 2) the current systems that exist are the hand we‚Äôve been dealt, I contend that the meaning of life is to‚ñ≥at the fastest rate you can within the system.In many ways, the meaning of life is to‚ñ≥Pragmatic Steps to accomplish this and my personal angleThe overarching theme is also that the world is one of nuance. There are no right answers to many of life‚Äôs questions. But at the same time, humans need heuristics to organize the world and defer to daily behaviors. While very few truths are absolute, I have begun forming a game plan and a set of principles that I use for tackling daily challenges and decisions.With this plan, we straddle the line between creativity and execution, life as a compounding step function, iteration and improvement, abstraction vs first principles, resource scarcity, the societal equivalent of the laws of physics, and the variable of time.EssaysSome of these essays ask questions, some of them answer questions, some of them simply plant the seed for questions that are answered later, but that is equally important.The CemeteryAt this time in my life, I had COVID and went for a walk in the nearby graveyard in Champaign.This essay introduced the question, ‚Äúwhat is the meaning of life?‚Äù and how the question itself is flawed. Humans tie too much value to symbols and words that are an abstracted meaning of purpose. Nothing has purpose. We just live in relation to objects whose purpose is seen in the context of our lives. A shovel serves us the purpose of digging, but a better question is ‚Äúwhat is a shovel?‚Äù or ‚Äúwhat is life?‚Äù which I revisit in a later essay titled conspicuously ‚Äúwhat is life?‚ÄùThe theme of this essay reveals that life is meaningless.Going to CaliforniaAt this time, I was in Palo Alto networking and conducting customer discovery for Nephra. I took focused time to explore Silicon Valley to understand what role it may play in my life.What I had realized at this time is that New York City is brute force and pessimistic. San Francisco is creative and optimistic. I had always considered myself to be someone who was not smart enough to arrive at genius novel solutions. Around this time period, I realized that, yes, I am stupid, but so is everyone else. Grit overrides intelligence.I also came away from this time period with an understanding that there truly are too different states of mind. One which is focused on execution and one on creation. The executing mind is one that is heads down and less aware of its surroundings, but accomplishes more. The creative mind is a wandering state and forms new connections and learns. I took away from this experience the ideal to be in a form of a superposition. You need to work hard to succeed. But you can‚Äôt work hard at just anything. You need enough creativity to work on the right thing and get to the right cliff of a step function. You need grit. You need leverage. You need both.The theme of this essay revealed the leverage in being different, and also working hard.Nephra EmailThis essay served as a time capsule of an email I sent to the Nephra team at the time where we had just finished competing in Cozad, the University of Illinois‚Äô big startup competition.It‚Äôs not to say that this specific email marked a grand realization, but in this time period, I did come to understand that the world is bottlenecked by engineering. What this means to me today is that ideas are much less important than the energy required to turn something into reality. What matters is having people who build the damn thing, which requires knowing how to build it, and having the resources to build it.I learned that the world is malleable. I learned that because I could see a problem glaring at me in the face that not everyone else saw and took time and effort to uncover, but also that many ideas have many teams working on them at any point in time‚Äìanother reason that execution matters more than ideas.I learned a bit about how to lead teams. I learned that it is one thing to get people on board. I learned that it is an entirely different thing to get them inspired, motivated, and maintain momentum. I learned that people need to work in person (I still don‚Äôt believe in remote work for startups). I learned that human beings only have so much RAM and need to focus on one thing.I learned to believe in myself. What did I know about biotech? I still won 2nd place in Cozad. I learned to accept ambiguity as what it is. When you know what you‚Äôre doing, have confidence. When you don‚Äôt know what you are doing, have faith.The theme of this essay revealed the the world is malleable, and that you can shape it. I started to uncover the importance of human focus and the inefficient allocation of it in our world today.Being AloneI spent some time on campus in our beautiful 101 E Armory toiling away on projects while others went home.I put pen to paper on some ideas that I knew, but didn‚Äôt quite know that I knew. I do not believe in happiness. Happiness is not a real thing, it is just your dopamine levels temporarily above your baseline. You will still be the same person tomorrow, happy or not. Similarly, suffering is not a real thing. These are both temporary human emotions. What is not temporary is how you grow as a human being.‚ñ≥is the meaning of life.I also understood another important thing in this time period. Just how mimetic human beings are and how dilutive being around others is to your belief system. We forget so easily and our beliefs are fungible depending on who we are sitting next to. This is fine if everyone around you and the information you consume is correct. But humans are irrational and emotional beings. It matters that you are very certain you want to become like these individuals, because you will.The theme of this essay revealed human herd-like tendencies and reminded me of the fleeting nature of emotion.A New ReligionAt this juncture in my life, I spent a lot of time with a religious friend who attempted to convince me of the realities of religion.I‚Äôm not going to say religion is fake with 100% certainty, but I will say it is fake with 99.9999% certainty. With that said, there is a lot we can learn from religion. What about religion is so unifying and has lasted such a test of time?The entire moral system that we know today is derived from Christianity, which became clearer when I later read the Genealogy of Morals. At this point, I also solidified my understanding that we have hit escape velocity in one area, technological progress and growth, which first started when we decided to stop killing each other, invest, and build stuff.The theme of this essay revealed religion is a plug that exists to solve the hole in human meaninglessness, and further that the moral fabric we see all around is us made up.A Year of StartupsAt this time, I had been working on Nephra for roughly a year and decided to log everything that I had learned.This was an extremely meaty essay, because it was real problems I had and had carried the burden of for a year. I caveat that with the fact that often the realizations were from building the plane as I went. So it would go that I would experience some problem, face it head on, not find an answer, and sometimes find some tidbit of information that patched it, which was realistically the best I could do at the time. An imperfect solution for some that is now hard to read.That said, there are still a lot of very real‚ñ≥experiences that I had during this year surrounding the struggles of a founder and going Zero to One, before I had read the book.Entrepreneurship is the process of creating something with nothing, or more with lessStartups are so ambiguous, which is not something that we are used to from the lives we‚Äôve lived where we are always given the instruction manual. So having to be skeptical while at the same time optimistic about the path you are on without actually knowing.Trust and the importance of co-founder strengths and relationshipsHaving ‚Äúit‚Äù and the sparkle in the eye. A candidate who has a ‚Äúwhy,‚Äù someone who knows independently why they do what they do. A surprisingly rare trait that shows agency. People who are excited and not paralyzed by an empty white board.Another summarization of the realization that the bottleneck of society is the lack of people who can actually build the damn thing. Looking back on this now, but also the inefficient allocation of skilled labor to important problems in society.The logarithmic importance of finding the right people early. Not compromising on hires.Culture is way more important than I previously thought. And you need to be a cult.People are always looking to the leader for validation and direction. You need to exercise the utmost thoughtfulness of what you say and when you say it.Don‚Äôt repeat mistakes. Learn from them. These scars become your assets and crystallized wisdom.The best way to be a great manager is to manage people that don‚Äôt need to be managed.Salary is only a way to buy a person‚Äôs time and ‚Äúget them on the bus.‚Äù You then also need inspiration and clarity of vision.In order to inspire others, you can‚Äôt lose, there is no way around it. You need to be a winner. But at the same time, when you take a loss, you need to take the fall, and when you win, you need to distribute recognition to others.Momentum is incredibly important for growing companies. Never let up on the gas. A startup is like a shark, if it stops swimming, it dies.Human beings should be completely absorbed in one problem at a time and human focus is the most valuable commodity on planet earth‚ÄúThe Shuffle‚Äù and gatekeepers of a company. How passing them is marginal progress leading up to consecutive steps in a step function.It‚Äôs not supposed to be easy. It‚Äôs supposed to be the hardest thing you will ever do.The theme of this essay revealed practical learnings on startupsBusiness == ExecutionIn this time period, I was graduating from the University of Illinois with a degree in finance and engineering.Essentially shitting on my business degree as a waste of time. Business is just the things you need to do to go from point A ‚Üí B. Businesses are just vehicles for accomplishing organized change, through‚ñ≥. Lots of little things that don‚Äôt require you to be a genius but just require you to work like hell‚Äìand working like hell does not mean working hard for just 40 hours a week‚Ä¶ Have a clear vision and back into it.The theme of this essay revealed again that business is just execution. Ideas matter less than proper execution. Looking back on this means the importance of doing the little things right and working really hard.The LogosAt this time, I was working very hard in investment banking at SVB Securities. Working really hard is what initially drew me to the job, but what I realized in this time period is that it matters what you work on and that there was no leverage in the salary I was receiving in a saturated and hyper-competitive¬† industry. I had readMeditationsand was influenced slightly by Marcus Aurelius and Stoicism, which felt natural to me. I had also read Balaji‚Äôs Network State at the same time I was realizing how difficult it was to do anything in biotechnology due to its regulatory regime and barriers to entry.This essay was partly another riff on the belief that the only continued and material change in the world is growth and technological progress.As a result of my earlier learnings, I really questioned if this trodden path was the best path to‚ñ≥. This was a linear path, a saturated path, a hyper-competitive path. The answer that I arrived at was that it was not in my best long-term interest.From my previous epiphanies that human focus is earth‚Äôs most valuable commodity, I had another epiphany that the world‚Äôs smartest were being shuttled through existing education programs that stifle creativity and individuality and sucked into these jobs out of college. They could be solving world hunger or nuclear fusion, but they are aligning logos on a screen. What I do believe is the only redeeming force of the education system is that at least much of it is the truth, we should adapt our neural networks to truth, otherwise we will have cracks in our foundation that will make it difficult to connect new future learnings to.At this time, I looked around at my peers to see if they had similar coming-to-God experiences. Why was I doing that job? To make money. First principles, what is money? It is a proxy. Proxy for what? Value. Do I need a lot of money? No. Do I think I could create more value in another way? Yes. All these questions stacked up into two main realizationsHuman focus is a horribly misallocated resourceMost people don‚Äôt have belief systems or know why they do anything, they‚Äôre inherited‚ÄúWe work jobs we hate, to buy things we don‚Äôt need, to impress people we don‚Äôt like.‚Äù- blah blah blah Fight ClubYou are basing your expectations off of those around you. Why not compete inwards and aim for the best scenario possible for you individually. What would be your perfect life? What would you be doing? Most people have some sort of odd plan that involves them doing a bunch of stuff so that they can do what they want in 20 years. Why not just do it right now?Then the question becomes what am I interested in? What is highly individual to me?I also go into my belief that we should innovate upon our current government and the importance of bitcoin. But I will not get into that right now.The theme of this essay reveals that most people live a life that is not their own, and that we should determine how you should live your own life based on your interests, without answering what those interests should be.Have ConvictionsAt this time, I also realized how little people around me believed they can change the systems that we are born into and view life as randomness.The first step to achieving your goals is believing that you can. When you know what you are doing, have confidence. When you don‚Äôt know what you are doing, have faith. This essay highlights the importance of believing in oneself and taking risks. People are often misguided in their approach to assessing risk. What is the risk of failure vs what is the risk of never doing anything meaningful with your life.‚ÄúWhen you grow up you tend to get told the world is the way it is and your life is just to live your life inside the world. Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family, have fun, save a little money. That's a very limited life.Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you and you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use. Once you learn that, you'll never be the same again.‚ÄùBasically, the last essay said that you should imagine a world where you can do whatever it is that you feel you should. This essay defines how we should actually go about that. Because other people have learned how to live a better life, you can too. If you can live a better life and not accept constraints, why wouldn‚Äôt you?The theme of this essay revealed again that the world is malleable and you can change it. It also took a stab at mapping who I am and what my interests are and continued to ask why?Biotech Week in ReviewAt this time, I was continuing research and deep learning catching up to the biotechnology industry.This essay was essentially a recap of Eroom's law and how biotech is not a realistic way for me to achieve my goals as a result of government regulation and high barriers to entry. It was a dead end and that‚Äôs fine. I recognized it and found that software may be the right way.The theme of this essay is the resistance to‚ñ≥in the biotechnology industry and how it was pushing me elsewhere.What is Life? (Part 1)At this point in time, I was going insane trying to understand the meaning of life in my shoebox NYC apartment while reading Nietzsche in the winter. Not a good combination.A revisiting of the earlier question. Breaking life down into the organic enthalpy in which we spontaneously arrived in the universe, before evolving to multicellular organisms, apes, and the person that you are today. There is no meaning in the individual carbon atoms, but we have evolved for a purpose, to live, like moths attracted to a light. We live and‚ñ≥as human beings with the instincts that we were provided at birth. Yet we live in a disastrous time. Culture and technology are now rapidly progressing at a speed that outpaces our own natural selection. We can run away from these instincts, but we won‚Äôt get very far, we‚Äôre wearing genes. Should we submit to our instincts or should we conquer them? What does it mean when in order to accomplish our evolutionary goal of growth, it requires that we go against the grain of our own genetic code? We are pigs in cages on antibiotics. We have hit evolutionary escape velocity through logic and computation, which we are not built for.The theme of this essay is how we don‚Äôt have meaning at that atomic level, but we can create meaning based on human instincts.Which Direction to Live It? (Part 2)A continuation of winter laden NYC shoebox apartment Nietzsche insanity.The goal of this essay was to fully reject existing moral systems in religion and society and overcome one's own vision of the universe, their role in it, and how that role provides man with his ‚Äúend‚Äù and path to fulfillment.In the previous essay, we established that humans are hardwired to expand and grow. We will dive deeper into this theme in this essay. Initially, we gave man religion to numb his meaninglessness. A moth was provided a light in the infinite darkness to fly towards. This essay explored what striving is and how we determine our values and meaning. What is our will, does it choose us, or do we have a say in this?We are provided multiple solutions on this conundrum. Schopenhauer contends that we should deny our nature. Nietzsche contends that we should embrace our nature and exercise our ‚Äúwill to power,‚Äù I ascribe to the latter but repurpose to the term ‚Äú‚ñ≥.‚ÄùWe used religion as a plug beforeNietzsche had his worries. He saw that in the past, we covered the meaningless with religion. The argument goes as follows:Base assumption: man, like any other animal, has no purpose. The moral systems we‚Äôve been fed have been created by those with power to keep power. The village leader of 10 people says ‚ÄúNo! Bad!‚Äù because a particular action erodes the glue of the system (and his power over it). Rules become laws to direct people into social conformity that is beneficial for the system. Systems live and die based on their ability to maintain order. Those that live on, pass on their genetic code in the form of morals.It is insufficient to simply recognize this lack of purpose, it is actually harmful. Nihilism unguided leads to man being lost in his world, and then to suicidal tendencies. He suffers from the void of his own meaning. The problem is the end. Why does man suffer? He will not suffer aimlessly, there must be a meaning. In fact, man invites suffering and often runs towards it. Of this era, Dostoevsky also writes, ‚ÄúMan is sometimes extraordinarily, passionately, in love with suffering.‚ÄùAsceticism and religion provided man with a double-barreled solution to the void.First, pegging meaning to an eternal salvation not visible in this world and attainable only after this life. Daily suffering is promised to be a temporary hurdle for infinite bliss. Man submits.Second, providing man the framework for him to purposefully suffer worldly suffering for the aforementioned salvation through doctrine and scripture on how to live the good life. A ‚Äúhow-to‚Äù manual. It is a cheap trick. You must accept this infinite power you cannot comprehend. Suffering in this world is prescribed for infinite bliss in the afterlife. Or hell if you fall out of line! Man is backed into a corner to accept.Nietzsche closes this loop with insisting that rather than feel guilt for morals created arbitrarily, man should let his instincts take hold in his natural will to power. Not to say be primitive, but to strive, for it is neither ugly nor beautiful but man‚Äôs truth to grow. Joy is not a real feeling and not what man seeks (like I mentioned with ‚Äúhappiness‚Äù). Man seeks an expansion of the self, an overcoming, a will to power. Joy is only the byproduct of seeing himself grow.Religion is understandableThe date is January 16, 2023, Martin Luther King Day. Walking through Greenwich looking for a coffee shop, I came across Our Lady of Pompeii church. I am catholic but abandoned my faith in my youth. I do admit that the smartest people I know are religious, so I never leave it out of the question. Curiosity dragged me through the cathedral‚Äôs wooden doors, and I was welcomed by tall dimly lit ceilings and what may have been the Halo theme song playing over the speakers.At that moment, I understood. I didn‚Äôt believe, but I understood. In an existential period where one is looking for answers, and where answers seem to only open doors to more questions, all of them with substance impossible to handle, like trying to grasp sand and it running right through your fingers or trying to capture the finity of cellular automata.But in that sublime moment, where you feel like you are seeing both the depths of history and the suffering of man embodied in the cross, accompanied by the kind, accepting, and forgiving vigil, you understand. At some point, man looking for answers becomes a mouse swimming in a jar of water. The relief comes from submitting to not knowing and giving up the pathetic effort of trying to swim. Submitting to the Bible and Christ‚Äôs open arms. Something infinitely greater than yourself. Religion provides man with his end.But I ain‚Äôt no bitch. I will not create a fake reality for peace. So I went on looking for answers.‚ÄúNow the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.‚Äù - John 8:32You should‚ñ≥. You should become more. You should be better. You should become all that you can be. Nietzsche doesn‚Äôt necessarily believe that this should be through making money. You can be the best skateboarder. You can be the best writer. You should have ambitions and work in a particular direction. You should work on what you are interested in. This is a personal thing only unique to YOU. But even then, I questioned why people are interested in anything? What should I should be interested in? I understand that some people are interested in things for the sake of things, but I am not that way. Once again, I went looking for answers.I wrestled with this question for a long time. I‚Äôve always felt odd that things didn‚Äôt interest me in the same way that they did other people. What is interesting about these things to these people. I have a feeling that it is not some arbitrary feeling, but a subliminal phenomenon that signals something. Often, we are interested in things that provide value to us. When Bill Gates was enthralled with the computer, he was at least partly interested because he saw its potential to change the world. Mimetic theory would say that people are interested in things that other people want. Charlie Munger says the world is not run on greed but on envy.I explore interests more in the next essay.The theme of this essay reveals how we should think about man‚Äôs search for meaning and how Nietzsche prescribes we‚ñ≥.AmbitionsAt this time in my life, Silicon Valley Bank failed while I was employed there, which was fun. I was beginning to come to terms with these questions and getting comfortable with an answer of my own.I think we are interested in things as a result of their ability to provide us value, truth, or some sort of characterological development. In some ways, life is just overcoming obstacles in the name of personal growth/expansion of the self.I saw a presentation with Ilya Sutskever, where he makes an interesting point that humans‚Äô loss function, essentially optimizing all variables in our lives for a certain outcome, is optimized for survival genetically. I think societal norms probably recalibrate this loss function towards other things like making money in capitalism, but it is still an interesting point. I think this is an important tangent for where our interests are derived.I believe that life is not supposed to be hedonism, nor is it supposed to be ascetic sacrifice. It is to be treated like a compounding investment, where you sacrifice a lot early and reap the rewards later.What interests me? What is the root of interest? I‚Äôve whittled away at this question for months and have been figuring out several things that make sense to me.After wrestling with this question, I genuinely believe our interests are fungible and we are interested in them because they ultimately provide us with value that enables us to‚ñ≥.If I were an early human, maybe fire would interest me. If I were in Florence in the 1500s, maybe I would be drawn to astronomy and the arts. If you were interested in something that forced you to be a peasant or women wouldn‚Äôt talk to you in the time, it would probably force your hand into a different interest, unless you were such a strong believer in that idealThe theme of this essay reveals the natural basis of our interests and how they enable‚ñ≥Value, Society, Money & WorkI was still in NYC at this time, probably floating around in an AirBnB in Harlem. Plotting what I wanted to do with my life and coming to the realization that leverage was getting whittled away in venture capital but was still existent in software company formation, especially with the big wave of AI oncoming. These interests primed me to make a quick jump to my current position at Shaper Capital, which I believe is well-positioned to capitalize on both.I questioned capitalism and how it forces us to live by its incentives in order to grow. How capitalism has consumed the world, and obscured the meaning of work. In our society, often the way to grow is only via the accumulation of capital, which has led to economic growth and prosperity at the detriment of personal satisfaction.My take at the end of the day is that people can reject this system, and it is well within their will to do so. In fact, Nietzsche would encourage one to reject systems that incentivize conformity.But I want to‚ñ≥. If capitalism is the best (or only) game in town, I‚Äôll play.It is clear that some people create scaled value. If you could choose between providing and capturing 1,000x that of a waitress, why would you not? Since there are people that learn to do this, it can be learned. Since it can be learned, I want to learn how to do it.The theme of this essay reveals some areas of inefficiency in the current markets and where my interests were pulling me for the prospect of‚ñ≥Abstraction vs. First PrinciplesI actually remember where I was when I wrote this. I think I was winding down my analyst stint with Leerink Partners and was sleeping on the floor of Kyle Vitale‚Äôs apartment. Then I went to a nearby coffee shop and wrote this just for something to do. This was after I had accepted my position with Shaper Capital. This essay wasn‚Äôt particularly relevant to anything at the time.It‚Äôs always better to work from first principles, but it just isn‚Äôt realistic. There is a fine line humans need to straddle for optimum results.These questions actually get infinitely complex when you break them down into cells and atoms. What is the essence of why we actually want to get rich? Why do we work? What does it mean to be a good person and whose ethical framework do we want to abide by? Is being a good person dependent on what we do in the moment or do the ends justify the means? Once again, if we were actually original in every way of life, it would be paralyzing to try to analyze everything, so we rely upon heuristics.So, when you say you want to get rich, what does that mean? Does having money allow you a lifestyle that you can live, or people you can associate with? Does it buy you your time? If you view money to buy you time, what would you do with that time? Why not just do that right now?There is a healthy balance. It‚Äôs okay to use proxies but take them with a grain of salt. I think the best way to approach these questions is to wrestle with two or more sides of the spectrum to try to arrive at the local maximum.The theme of this essay continues the discussion on the importance of nuance.TimeCreate a plan for your future. If you want to accumulate capital, you will need to add value. Do not just participate in the market, work within the constraints of time and resources to actively shape it. The first $1,000,000 is the most difficult.This was actually a much more profound essay than this description lets off.The theme of this essay reveals a mathematical modeling approach to the variable T and the importance of time accelerating the compounding of‚ñ≥.New Essay: The Hollow PyramidThe previous essays define The Logos and‚ñ≥.What follows is an extremely important point on the second meaning behind ‚Äú‚ñ≥.‚Äù Once you have defined your goal and plan, you need to execute. You need to have focus.Somewhere around 14 years old, I came to a realization that I hadn‚Äôt been able to articulate over the last decade but that I think well encapsulates my philosophy that human focus is the most valuable commodity on planet earth‚ñ≥I was in AP Psychology class and we were learning about Maslow‚Äôs Hierarchy of Needs. At this time of my life, I had learned to work very hard.The professor I had was a substitute, but she was brilliant. She expounded how human needs are met at each rung of the hierarchy (Food, Shelter, Sex, Community, etc.) and how each enables the next on the path towards self-actualization. I reject this. These rungs only lead to dopamine above baseline, which is unsustainable and fleeting. I believe self-actualization comes from‚ñ≥, which requires denying comfort at each rung, staying hungry, and instead focusing on greatness and solving the problems at hand.This is not to say we should suffer for the sake of suffering, we shouldn‚Äôt, but we should prioritize‚ñ≥before suffering and use discomfort as a weapon to maximize‚ñ≥.Suffering and ComfortI get shit from people when I tell them that I have never felt stressed in my life, and I have certainly never felt any form of depression. I have suffered, though, and I have been focused. Suffering is the most pure lever I have ever found that amplifies focus and performance. If I had an enemy, I would similarly leverage happiness to keep them comfortable and stagnant.Humans love comfort. Comfort is distracting. Comfort and happiness are some of the most damaging emotions you can experience. You will never find the resistance that you need to sharpen you in times of comfort.I am not a materialist, material distracts from focus. I don‚Äôt care much for money, unless I can spend it increasing time and focus.Human focus is earth‚Äôs most valuable commodity.For whatever reason, I became comfortable with suffering early in life to the point where I actually do not recognize it, nor do I acknowledge happiness. It has always been the case in my life that the more difficult things have been, the more that I‚ñ≥. My philosophy has unknowingly always been to reject oneself for the sake of‚ñ≥.Try fasting, try deleting all the apps, try really pushing yourself to the limits. Your dopamine levels will adjust to that baseline and you will be able to run through any brick wall that presents.This is also one of the most helpful ways to increase the need for growth. It pushes you to compete inwards, no matter how comfortable you may feel. Stay humble, stay hungry.The reason I couldn‚Äôt figure this out before was because it‚Äôs not like denying yourself is some magic pill for growth. Nietzsche would agree there is no sanctity in asceticism. There is, however, the ability to focus and propensity to‚ñ≥.Don‚Äôt suffer just to suffer. Suffer as a lever to improve performance and focus, especially for delayed gratification.FocusThroughout history, many people are often defined by even just one experience, one philosophy, one trait, one accomplishment. Focus is more important than diversification if you want to accomplish amazing things. What makes me unique? What do I believe that no one else does? What do I know that no one else does? What am I the best in the world at? You will find incredible leverage in that one thing.I believe in focus so much that I have devised a routine and written a ritual to remind myself every morning the derivation of my purpose and what that means for what I should be doing at this very moment. Humans lack focus. Especially in such a mentally stimulating time where we are distracted at every moment of every day, with shorter and shorter attention spans, I deeply believe in long-term focus at one goal.That one thing often becomes the magnum opus that a person becomes remembered for. That one thing is what I will tailor my future company's cultures towards. That one thing is what I will look for in candidates. That one thing is the rule that I will live my life by.I don‚Äôt know if you can tell yet, but I believe human focus is Earth‚Äôs most valuable commodity.For all that has gone wrong and all that has gone right: if you had not stepped foot in that cemetery: if you had not gone to California: if you had not had Quant & Nephra: if you had not discovered engineering: if you had not spent time in isolation: if you had not questioned religion: if you had not worked a dead-end job in investment banking: if you had not invested in the best performing asset of the year: if you had not forged a connection that turned out to be the relationship needed for your dream job: if you had not earned a degree in a field that was a waste of time: if you had not been trapped in a shoebox apartment during NYC‚Äôs winter: if you had not came across Our Lady of Pompeii Church and stepped in its doors: if you had not gotten rid of your belongings and floated to an AirBnB in Harlem: if you had not quit your job and slept on the floor of Kyle Vitale‚Äôs apartment: you would not be here sipping wine and eating Takis.‚ÄúAll that is very well, ‚Äúbut let us cultivate our garden‚ÄùNo. Let us‚ñ≥.Practical Principles For Company Formation -(these can be refined over time)‚ñ≥- The meaning of life is to ‚ñ≥. Everyone on board should be aligned. That is the goal of the company. That is the goal of the employees. We want people who ‚ñ≥ fast.Focus- Human focus is the most valuable commodity on planet earth, and it is limited, humans only have so much RAM. Focus so hard it hurts, the pain will point you in the right direction. Instill a culture of growth and trust. Unleash human focus on infinite games (goals with no upper bound).Why? And Vision -A core tenant to my philosophy is having a ‚Äúwhy.‚Äù Know what you do and why you do it and how it fits into the broader vision. Engineers solve problems. Make sure they're problems that matter. Similarly, be very purposeful with the incentives you create. Create win-win-wins. The leaders set the pace. ‚ÄúHaving a vision is what tends to separate the leaders from the followers‚Äù - Richard Hamming. People look to you. Do not stray. Leaders set an endpoint (use this power wisely). People will look as you do, not just what you say. Be consistent.Talent- The right people matter. Hire for strengths over lack of weaknesses. Quality over quantity. The bottleneck of society is finding people that can actually build the damn thing. Co-founders matter. Trust matters. Talent Density. Get the right people and inspire them.Execution, Velocity, Momentum- Execution matters. Speed matters. Momentum matters. Momentum comes from winning and believing deeply. Business is a mindset. Everyone needs to row in the same direction, be a cult. Cut bureaucracy immediately.Culture- Culture matters. Create a place where the extremely ambitious go. Ambitious and smart people like working with other ambitious and smart people. If you create a place that is good to work, when things hit the fan (they will), people won't leave.Reserved Optimism- Learning and understanding matters. Indeterminacy (learning) vs determinacy (execution). But often the best learning comes from doing. So defer to doing. If you know what you are doing, have confidence. If you don‚Äôt know what you are doing, have faith. Startups shouldn‚Äôt look at risk the same way an investor would. Burn the boats, make it happen.First Principles- Think in first principles; question every assumption and proxy. Most things are a means to an end. Compete inward, escape outward competition. Focus on infinite games.Logic- Computers are changing the world. The world of bits is not a bad horse to hitch a ride to.Learn- Don‚Äôt make the same mistake twice.Step-Functions- Life is not linear, it is an exponentially compounding step function whose upper limit is the business equivalent of the laws of physics. If I look back on my life, each ‚ñ≥ has been the result of a long preparation and a step-up that took longer than expected but happened quicker than I thought.Suffering- It‚Äôs not supposed to be easy. It‚Äôs supposed to be the hardest thing you‚Äôve ever done. Suffering and happiness are both temporary emotions that you can ignore for long term ‚ñ≥.",No date
ESSAY 11: TIME,https://jonathanpolitzki.substack.com/p/essay-11-time,"This thing all things devours:Birds, beasts, trees, flowers;Gnaws iron, bites steel;Grinds hard stones to meal;Slays king, ruins town,And beats high mountain down.IntroductionTime is the single most important constraint of the universe, yet we too often forget the variable, T, in our economic models.Time is required for planning. In my current job, things have been going really well. Over the past year, much of my time went into formulating a plan for where I would like to be. Now, it feels like I‚Äôm where I want to be. The question then becomes how do I execute better right here, right now?Planning is essential. People have workout plans, moving plans, birthday plans, cooking plans. But many people don‚Äôt create plans for their lives. They should. When I played chess, there was a common adage that ‚Äúa bad plan is better than no plan.‚Äù I wanted to lay out a plan for how to maximize my output and create clarity around my path forward. That was the original intent of this essay.But with every plan I wanted to create, I kept running into the constraint of time. Time is a central variable to every plan, instruction manual, etc. While I was writing notes for myself, they turned into a much longer template for this essay on time.The Past and PresentIn order to plan for the future, it is important to know your history and present state. Who were you? Who are you now? Can you connect the dots to project a forward looking trajectory? So I asked the question, what are my strengths, weaknesses, and individual characteristics. 5‚Äô11, 23.9178 years old, hyper-ambitious, intellectually curious, dashingly handsome‚Ä¶ Sparing the details, I deeply believe that the person I am today can accomplish whatever I set my mind to.Set your time horizon. The median male lives ~73 years, so we can assume I‚Äôve got another fifty in me. That‚Äôs a lot of time, and yet not much at all.Then identify in exact detail what end goal you have for 5, 10, 25, 50 years and bridge the gap between the two states through concerted effort.InterestsWhat you do in between is what you need to do and want to do to accomplish your goals. What are my interests? Why are we interested in anything? After belaboring this question across several essays, I‚Äôve determined that my interests lie in their ability to provide me opportunities for growth and striving.I am interested in finance & technology, because money runs the world, and technology changes it. These are also areas of leverage in capitalism, which I will get to later.In this world we were born into, money is the proxy for value and growth. Understanding the proxy isn‚Äôt perfect, I will still measure growth in money and profits. Money runs the world.Capital AccumulationUnless you are stealing, the trodden path to capital accumulation comes from providingXamount of value and capturingY%of the value through the transaction(s). You can do this yourself directly or through the ownership of an organization, network, business, etc. that provides the value.Time as a VariableTime is extremely important in business. It is an often forgotten variable in the equation of value capture. You can build your company with many specific goals in mind. One is to purposefully engineer your company in a way to maximize velocity.Time is important for 3 reasons. One is strategic and the other two can be thought of as optimizing a variable in the capture of value:Business Strategy (strategic)Speed of execution and momentum are powerful differentiators as a business strategy in shipping new products, pivoting, capturing market share when network effects matter, etc. Travis May, CEO of Shaper Capital, says that businesses often don‚Äôt operate near theefficient frontierwhere speed trades off with quality, budget, and other constraints.‚ÄúStrategy, its high-church theologians insist, is about outflanking competitors with big plays that yield long-term ‚Äúrents‚Äù from a sustainable advantage. It is questionable whether this proposition is itself sustainable. Strategy involves a lot more and also a lot less. The competitive scriptures almost systematically ignore the importance of hustle and energy.‚Äù - Harvard Business Review:Note: Read Hustle as a Strategy - HBRThis is also why software has captured my attention, it is fast, and not in a ‚Äúget rich quick‚Äù kind of way. Coming from the world of biotech, if it de-facto takes years to get to market and regulatory bodies punish you every step of the way with extremely high upfront R&D costs, the barriers, drag and friction to success are too high.‚ÄúI think there is something about software itself that's very, very powerful. Software has these incredible economies of scale - these low marginal costs - and there is something about the world of bits as opposed to the world of atoms where you can often get very fast adoption and fast adoption is critical to capturing and taking over markets. Because even if you have a small market, if the adoption rate is too slow there'll be enough time for other people to enter that market and compete with you whereas if you have a small to midsize market and have a fast adoption rate, you can take over the market.‚Äù - Peter Thiel.Time to success is speeding up. This software-margin enabled high-velocity company blitzscaling is a large factor in how Time to market is speeding up. You used to hear war stories of the older generation about how they painstakingly built their company over a period of 50 years. That is now 5 (still painstaking) years in software.In addition to accomplishing things faster. If you put more hours in per day, you will accomplish more in aggregate, despite less being accomplished on the margin. I was never a smart kid or the best in school, but I did pretty well for myself by simply outworking the competition.For inspiration, here are also remarkable examples of people quickly accomplishing ambitious things together. You wouldn‚Äôt want to compete with these teams.Fast - Patrick Collison. The Manhattan Project took 3 years. What if it took 10?Captured Value Per Time UnitMake more money in less time. If it takes one salesman 4 hours to source and close a customer and you cut time in half you are doubling the efficiency of your salesman. If you then allow him to run 2x the prospects in parallel, you are quadrupling the net new bookings. It is not this simple in practice, but the idea that if you multiply the amount of sales done per quarter / per annum is powerful. InFigure 1below, this is equivalent to dividingTby 4. You are quadrupling revenue and making a leaner business per unit of time.Figure 1:To create some logic around this concept, the following formula represents the value captured per unit of time.A = Value Captured Per Time UnitX = Value CapturedY (0 -100) = Portion of Value CapturedT = Time UnitCompounding ValueArrive sooner. What if we harnessed electricity 100 years earlier? What would society look like today?The majority of a company‚Äôs payoff comes after it has reached a more mature state in the future. When valuing a company, often over 70% of the company‚Äôs value comes from its terminal value in a discounted cash flow analysis. This is when it has topped out in growth, generates the most cash flows, and is expected to operate into perpetuity.X and Y are not constants. Profits increase exponentially. We should both expect and push extremely hard to increase the slope of the growth curve and value we provide as revenue scales / product becomes more useful. We should also expect margins to widen with economies of scale. By scaling a business 2x as fast, we are able to hit our terminal value in 5 years vs 10 years. Referring toFigure 2here.Figure 2:To be honest, I haven‚Äôt taken calculus since high school, and I don‚Äôt even remember if I‚Äôm doing this correctly, but this is supposed to represent the integral and cumulative value captured over T time period.C = Cumulative Value Captured Over Time in PeriodMultiply your value. Imagine that the business inFigure 3is sold at year 2.5 at a 10x revenue multiple for $50 million. If the company had arrived at year 5 sales in half the time, the company would be selling at a 10x revenue multiple for $250 million. Do not underestimate the value of compounding.Figure 3:The actual value captured over time depends on the time horizonThe three forces work together. What‚Äôs more important than the principle of each of these separately is the value of the three combined. If your competitive speed allows you to gobble up market share and ship new products to expand, make 4x the revenue per salesman/year, and the speed of your business means you get 5 years of work done in a 2.5 year period, you will be so far ahead of your competition that they will never catch up to you.Figure 4:The same principles that apply to physics apply to growing your business. You should be accelerating constantly, increasing the speed of your organization, and the distance you reach will compound over years. An even 1% increase in acceleration per year will pay massive dividends.ProfitNow we understand the importance of time in compounding profit, essentially minimizing the value ofvariable T.Next, we should dig into how exactly to make money in each unit of time. My findings so far is that making money is easy. However, making a lot of money is hard and ROI becomes harder to find with scale. You need leverage to accomplish more than what you are able to do with your humanly time, essentially maximizingvariables X and Y.The three major buckets of leverage I explore are leverage over people, assets, and financial leverage (these buckets are blurry and could probably be reworked). In each of these, there are inputs and there are outputs.Both can be thought of as aiming for a high Return on Investment. Both can also be seen as lowering inputs and increasing outputs. Both can be thought of as maximizing margins. They‚Äôre all interconnected and maybe I will even propose a new economic term for the intersection of the two one day.Leverage of PeopleHire people to add more time to your day. Because your time is limited, and your focus is valuable, you should pay other people money to conduct operations in your place. This shouldn‚Äôt be thought of as pure leverage. Ideally both transactors, the employer and employee benefit from the working relationship.This is a required step in scaling yourself. This could be its own essay as well. It is not possible to be the best at everything. At some point in time you will need to hire someone to accomplish something that you are simply not able to alone. At the same time, developing skills and increasing the value of your own time is important to know where to invest your time and resources. You should learn to develop these forms of trust and relationships from the beginning so that your management strategy can scale.In order for this to function, ideally employee wage < present value of profits associated with the person.Leverage of AssetsIf you own an asset that either stores value or generates cash flows, it has intrinsic value that is not directly tied to your time. An example would be a golden goose that lays a golden egg every day. This can also be leverage of technology to compete better.You can buy these assets at a discount to their intrinsic value, use the passive income to accumulate additional assets, create these assets with your own time, etc. This pattern is also found in the next category.Leverage of EquityYou invest money in an ongoing concern/business. This can almost be thought of as a combination of 1 & 2. You are buying or building a living and breathing corporate organization that functions as a machine of moving pieces of people, networks, and assets. Labor/investment as an input and profit/desired change as an output.Each business has their own unique combination of inputs and outputs that best positions it to provide value to their customers and then secure a portion of it.Berkshire Hathaway does this through investment alone, Elon does it through company building alone. Value investment is just value arbitrage. Buying good companies at a cheap price. The alternative is to build a great company from scratch. Which should you do? I argue there is a tradeoff.Time vs Resources TradeoffI equate the tradeoff of output relative to labor and investment in the same way that Einstein outlines The Theory of Special Relativity, which explains how energy and mass are interrelated. It outlines the formula e=mc^2, which states that energy is equivalent to mass times the speed of light squared.Similarly, it seems to me that just like a small amount of mass can produce a huge amount of energy, a small amount of time and labor (your work) can lead to a significant amount of profit, especially when multiplied by smart investment strategies (like the speed of light squared in the equation). Larger mass generally equates to higher energy. Larger starting investment equates to more profit/growth. Not a perfect analogy, especially sincecis supposed to be constant.Which should you do then? Should you invest in assets and people? Should you invest in businesses? Should you create your own? It depends.If the goal of this exercise is purely profit-driven and to maximize ROI, then ‚Ä¶. It also depends. It depends on who you are, what you have, what you know, who you know, and the current state of the world.It depends on the value of your time.Value of Time from Financial LeverageSomeone who has $10,000,000 can invest that money and make $500,000/year without working. They are using leverage over their capital and taking up a low salary job would not be worthy of their time.Value of Time From Work Exerted Upon a SystemIf you have no resources to invest, your only asset is yourself. If you are flat broke with no skills, you need to work an unskilled job and invest in yourself.Someone who has $0 in the bank has Zero financial leverage. How do they create value out of thin air? This is the problem that all us broke-ass mortals have to face. Assuming we have no other resources, the only way that they can accumulate capital is by using our time to create value in the world and capture it or to sell our time itself to a company for value we provide to them.If you have leverage over a network of people, a skill set, or some other resource, that increases the value of your time and ability to leverage these resources to earn a profit. But you will still be deriving income from other forms of leverage.Probably within this time to earnings matrix, there is a breakdown of the leverage you can get from different jobs. As a general rule, it is better to be paid in equity at a company you contribute greatly to the success of; however, lawyers don't do too poorly billing hourly. You just need to create X value and capture Y% of it. However, as a human being, you can only scale yourself so far.Unskilled hourly employeeSalarySkilled SalaryCommissionLeading a TeamEquity in the CompanyEfficient MarketsThis is probably why people say making your first $1,000,000 is always the hardest. To build yourself up from a worthless human with no skills and no network and no cash in the bank to a net worth of $1,000,000 is the early part of the growth curve and is excruciatingly painful. This is no-man‚Äôs land, because you don‚Äôt really even have access to financial leverage. The ROI on a $200,000 investment to support your life and reinvest the surplus is high. You would need to return 25% YOY to regularly bring in $50,000/year pre-tax. Even Wall Street‚Äôs best can‚Äôt squeeze much greater than the market average of 8%/year from the market.This is because the public stock market is mostly efficient. It is difficult to gain a high Return on Investment. So extracting Y% is more difficult because it is difficult to find mispricings. Warren Buffet continues to sit on a pile of cash. This is also in large part due to the scale of Berkshire Hathaway. It‚Äôs hard to find enough good deals. Warren guarantees he could return 50% if he was only investing ~$1,000,000.In fact, most markets are efficient now. Starting from the most liquid and efficient mega-cap companies downstream through private equity investors LBOs to growth equity, and the recent inundation of money into venture capital. Doug Leone of Sequoia recently said in a podcast that venture has permanently shifted from a high margin cottage industry to a low margin mainstream business. It's going through a parallel evolution that private equity/buyouts went through in the 90s/2000s. You now have ""megafund"" venture shops that are raising fund sizes on par with PE, which was unheard of a decade ago. For the last decade, mid to late stage growth equity has been where the easiest alpha was - put a bunch of money into a basket of SaaS startups at Series B/C/D, and like magic they would IPO in a few years at a 5-10x MOIC. Now it's arguably the seed stage, where all the money and deals are crowding now. VC will have its up and down cycles, but it is forever now a true institutional asset class, with tons of competition and decreasing alpha. PE in the 90s up to the early 2000s for example was much less competitive and institutional than it is today. Now it's brutally hard to build a career in buyouts, with more investors with more dry powder chasing the same deals. Still achievable of course, but the degree of difficulty and level of competition is an order of magnitude higher. Venture is undergoing the same dynamic. I don't know if it's honestly a good place to build a career anymore. It's certainly a lot harder to advance and generate returns now and going forward.Even software has become pretty efficient. Where there is a problem, there is probably a software solution.The one counter-point I have to the fact that saturated markets are harder to win is that they are the industries that often have the most capital available for capture.Find inefficient markets to capture more value.Inefficient MarketsIn theory, any market could be inefficient. Technology is just interesting because it can catalyze a seismic change that disrupts an efficient market. However, you can also invest based on socio-political events and the likes. It feels like while other events can change the course of humanity, they are mostly moral questions.Most markets oscillate between inefficient and efficient due to new technology. AI and crypto are going to shake things up in a similar but different way that the internet and software did. Crypto is version 2 of the techno-libertarian internet movement and the return of monetary governance to private markets. AI is software 2.0 and enables us to better work with computers. It‚Äôs almost like software went from analog to digital, only to go back to digitally enabled analog systems. I imagine this as a computer that you speak to and it understands you, rather than breaking the entire system if there is a missing 0 or 1 in the underlying machine language. AI is also much more than this. Just as there slowly became a playbook for value investing, then software, the same will occur for these technologies.Zero to Oneis what really enabled me to come to this realization. I believe that the last frontier for inefficient markets are the markets that do not exist yet. Technological development is accelerating and sure as hell will not stop. This is the next stage of human evolution. Not because it is morally right, but because it wins.Even when these markets are small, they are growing fast. So you need to act fast to wedge yourself in and expand. Time matters.Zero to OneFor this reason,Zero to Oneis way ahead of its time and will go down as the piece that represents this generational tectonic shift. I will not do the injustice of putting Thiel‚Äôs words in my own poor writing style. Read it if you have not.Also, you don‚Äôt necessarily need to go from 0 to 1, or 1 to 2, or 10 to 100, or 1,000,000 to n. Each of these are different opportunities and require different skill sets for different inefficiencies.What I will say is that if you are the person who owns the machine, rather than an agent of it, you can put the right resources and people in place to make the machine run optimally. I don‚Äôt know what this role in a company is, but it is what I want to do. CEO?Company Formation VCsVenture capital is going through a phase of its evolution. The biggest generalist VCs become a stamp/commodity, the few winners take all, and specialized VCs take hold as they are more skilled in their area of expertise at lead generation and investment decisions. In a lot of ways, VCs have become commoditized ‚Äúmoney providers.‚ÄùUse the‚Äúbut-for test‚Äùto see which party provides the most value to society. The but-for test is a test commonly used in both tort law and criminal law to determine actual causation. These companies could have been started without the VCs, but could not have been started‚Äúbut for‚Äù the founders. When in any startup, you quickly realize that the bottleneck of progress is just having people who actually build the damn thing.Be the person who actually builds the damn thing.Y Combinator essentially acts as a fish net/index fund/esteemed university for people who actually build the damn thing. It was essentially a realization that the engineers are the people who actually have the value to create the software companies. They are a really interesting business model that I expect to exist for a long time, similar to universities. But accelerators are passive. They help the founder to raise. However, just as a student graduates from college, they can graduate from Y Combinator. By the founder‚Äôs second company, giving up 7% of a founder‚Äôs company may no longer make sense for the YC stamp/network. Or maybe YC will forever play an important role in many companies‚Äô formation.They also say that the best VCs have run companies in the past. So I think it could make sense that the next generation of VCs are both a founder and investor. They know their markets. They can create, lead, and invest in the next generation of organizations that will go on to ‚Äúshape‚Äù (Shaper Capital) those industries.Venture Studios aren‚Äôt even the right term. These are investors and operators who specialize in going from 0 to 1. Still trying to think of a better name. If you look at Founders Fund today, they are who do this. They invest in companies, but also start them if they see a problem or inefficient market that has not been solved.I wonder if we will see vertically integrated funds. Creating the company, leading its rounds, and then reinvesting its dividends across many companies at scale.What investment strategy comes before company formation and 0-1? There is nothing before 0. The only thing I can think of would be an investor like Flagship Pioneering, who forms the company after they have already incubated breakthrough science through experimentation. So engineers/scientists keep winning?This may actually be the final phase of great investment companies. Perhaps it will continually fragment. Some will win for a time, then lose, and others will take their place. The cycle of life.What I do know, however, is that technology is the infinite frontier. Until computers have replaced us, there will never be a lack of problems in society that humans can exercise their time and agency upon to solve.One of the great things that I am starting to learn is don‚Äôt be a commodity. This goes hand in hand with the idea that whatever it is you do, make sure it provides value and do it the best in the world. Do it so well that you are playing your own game and no one will ever catch up with you.Company formation is also a messy process. I think you can commoditize a founder‚Äôs playbook and do it at scale, so that the only thing left is to find new problems and continue to execute better.We have the playbook for software for the most part. It probably makes sense to begin drafting that up more explicitly. And it also probably makes sense to start drafting the playbook for starting an AI company more explicitly.The New PlaybookI am yet to see what the strategy will be yet, but I expect that the strategy of these new formation VCs will differ widely depending on the firm. It will likely be like an entrepreneur with significant company formation experience doing it without having to think about raising capital. So it will be like the investment process has become commoditized and done in-house.Most traditional VCs without experience building companies will not be able to effectively run a venture studio. In order to become the type of person who would run a company formation VC well, you first need to become a strong individual contributor and learn how to build a company. You need to learn how to do it so you can do it multiple times at scale.Each will have a different culture. Each will have a different strategy. Each will be knowledgeable in its own domain.ConclusionCreate a plan for your future. If you want to accumulate capital, you will need to add value. Do not just participate in the market, work within the constraints of time and resources to actively shape it.",No date
ESSAY 10: ABSTRACTION VS FIRST PRINCIPLES,https://jonathanpolitzki.substack.com/p/essay-10-abstraction-vs-first-principles,"Abstraction vs First PrinciplesAt the beginning of the year, I was really interested in two ideas: Abstraction and First Principles. These both are necessary modes of thinking for human beings, but they often counter each other. I will say that I went looking and looked very hard. The only ultimate truth I found is that there are no ultimate truths.I can‚Äôt really imagine a brain that could only do one or the other, they are both necessary.When I think about abstraction, to me it means creating heuristics or rules about a collection of data points. It is a practice of pattern recognition, extrapolation or interpolation or however the brain works that I don‚Äôt understand. Humans are simple creatures, and we package these heuristics into symbols that we reference for later use.Convolutional Neural Networks Work SimilarlyThere is also the idea of first principles, which is zooming in on each of the data points and questioning our overarching theories. Since these heuristics are imperfect, they can cause misinterpretations or miss out on key nuances. It is necessary for an engineer to approach problems in first principles, and we should approach problems in fields like literature and politics all the same.Tend to First Principles ‚Äì The Resource TradeoffFirst principles is theoretically the best course of action. But we are faced with resource and time constraints, so humans often defer to abstraction or mimetically deferring to others assumptions. It would be hard to imagine waking up and efficiently going to work every day without having these unquestioned, instinctual behaviors.Problems Due to Abstraction - Rules were meant to be broken.Many problems in our society are due to deferring to symbols of understanding and abstraction. If you think about it, the Constitution is largely used for the purpose of setting standard laws that should remain true over time, while leaving room for change. As the country evolves over millennia, some of these are going to become outdated. Many heuristic dissolve over time.We maybe understand that we like a certain ideology and so we vote for a party that falls under the abstraction of democrat or conservative. That‚Äôs not why we vote though? The party is just a way to divide a spectrum of policies into two buckets. However, many don‚Äôt really investigate whether the candidate‚Äôs stance mirrors their own. Further, these stances might be cloudy takes that don‚Äôt address the real problem. ‚ÄúI am going to stop all wars‚Äù avoids the perfectly reasonable fact that wars are sometimes necessary to survive. Politics is plagued by this issue because the population of interest / target market you are selling to isn‚Äôt knowledgeable. Democracy has its flaws.In chess, we make rules like keep the knights in the center of the board, get rooks on open lines and control the center. Play chess against a computer engine, Magnus, Kasparov or Tal and you will see powerful counterintuitive moves. A dim knight on the rim has made my life miserable on multiple occasions.Similarly in business, you may learn general rules like never compromise on hires, the customer is always right, and to always align all stakeholders. Just to make an example with one of these, the customer is not always right.Every Situation is UniqueI think the largest realization I‚Äôve had recently is that I spend so much time learning from others from any source I can find, looking desperately for ‚Äúultimate truths of business.‚ÄùBusiness isn‚Äôt mathematics. The reality is there are no ultimate truths of business. Every industry, person, and problem is inherently distinct. A quote that I will reapply from Peter Thiel here is,‚ÄúThe next Bill Gates will not start an operating system. The next Larry Page won't start a search engine. The next Mark Zuckerberg won't start a social network company. If you are copying these people, you are not learning from them.‚ÄùHeuristics are still helpful. Jeff Bezos used two heuristics that generally hold up. The assumption that customers will always want their items to arrive faster and cheaper. And that if you improve on those two metrics you can never go wrong.Working hard tends to be pretty good advice as well. I‚Äôve spent a lot of time learning from those who have found success in software and finance, but I think that the necessary next step is to unlearn many lessons and create my own framework that will work well for me.This problem goes much deeper and permeates how we think about everythingI think this problem is sneakily much larger than even the above lets off. Humans are goal- and purpose-oriented creatures. The problem is that humans no longer use religion as the great north star of our internal compass, we fill it with other concepts or identities. Whether that is to be a good person, to get rich, to be a good student, etc.These questions actually get infinitely complex when you break them down into cells and atoms. What is the essence of why we actually want to get rich? Why do we work? What does it mean to be a good person and whose ethical framework do we want to abide by? Is being a good person dependent on what we do in the moment or do the ends justify the means? Once again, if we were actually original in every way of life, it would be paralyzing to try to analyze everything, so we rely upon heuristics.People often look to others who have become rich and try to emulate their strategies. The problem is that these strategies may not always work the same in the next generation. In the gold rush, wall street boom, internet bubble, the software revolution, and now crypto and AI, these waves are idiosyncratic and distinct in their own ways. We can keep saying that we‚Äôre in the next internet software revolution, and that‚Äôs a helpful way to think about it, but that same playbook will never work perfectly again.The founders that compete well in each wave also have different skill sets and personalities. Within those waves, there are different types of businesses that are born, which require different lines of thinking. Being different is your asset, not a liability. There are things we can learn from each of these instances, but no time is ever the exact same. Possibly, the only constant is to be different, unique, individual, and rather than shape to the crowd, shape to the problems you face.Dig DeeperSo, when you say you want to get rich, what does that mean? Does having money allow you a lifestyle that you can live, or people you can associate with? Does it buy you your time? If you view money to buy you time, what would you do with that time? Why not just do that right now?When people say they want to be an entrepreneur, what they are often saying is ‚ÄúI want to be rich and famous,‚Äù because there is a certain image of an entrepreneur that we have as a society.I‚Äôm trying to just touch grass more, looking internally rather than externally.After I graduated high school, even though I was interested in science, I studied finance, because I wanted to start businesses and make money, only to find out that you can start many different types of businesses and that finance isn‚Äôt really a necessary skill to start businesses. It‚Äôs just a skill to understand the flow of capital‚Äî‚Äúbusiness‚Äù is a broadly stroked blanket abstraction that hides the fact that each business is unique. You can start an infinite number of businesses with different business models. I looked outward. Now I ended up in biotech anyways and boy would that science degree have been helpful‚Ä¶I then matriculated into investment banking because at the University of Illinois, it seemed like the only available class of people who went on to be successful. A problem of availability bias that I then pegged to my understanding of the world. Once there, I realized that my personality is not one that fits in well. I was trying to fit a square box in a round hole.How to Approach Problems?What became apparent in my first real job, which is both a strength and a weakness is I don‚Äôt like convention‚ÄîI like the big picture. Banking was extremely process oriented and rooted in convention, in addition to requiring granular attention to detail for things that I often that werede minimus. It‚Äôs interesting, if you ask someone who works in banking at another company, their day-to-day always almost completely reflects yours‚Äîmanaging trackers, making profiles, etc. The industry is mature and quite set in its ways. There was a lot that I learned from it, but I have always been someone who tries to fully understand every angle, possibility, the essence of a problem and think through the best way forward, then executing. The thing that constantly hurt me was having certain boxes I needed to check without anyone really questioning or understanding why we were checking them, and then having to execute quickly constantly, without having much time to question the process. I never liked school for this reason, and it felt like my first job was to do homework professionally.I have been increasingly changing my view of the world to one of nuance. Maybe partly due to growing up with multiple choice questions, I had begun to believe the world had answers and they were determinate. The earth is a giant ball of confusion, and it is an infinitely multi-dimensional gradient.This is of course a super hard way to conceptualize problems, but that‚Äôs exactly how they all work. Problems are faced with multiple input variables, multiple output variables, entropy, irrationality, non-linearity, etc. Now, instead of picking a heuristic, I try to identify multiple opposing modes of thought and wrestle on the gradient between them. I try to question convention. Don‚Äôt listen to convention. Color outside the lines. They‚Äôre often set arbitrarily.For instance, the heuristic I previously mentioned has two takes: (1) the customer is always right and (2) if Ford asked a customer for what they wanted they would have said faster horses.(1) Some say the idea doesn‚Äôt matter and startups are about execution, but (2) of course the idea matters because there are constraints and different sized pockets of value that may never work.We shouldn‚Äôt defer to optimism or pessimism; we should be both a hardcore optimist and pessimist and constantly wrestle between the two. We shouldn‚Äôt be an insider or an outsider, both have advantages at different times. We shouldn‚Äôt be either creative or purely executive, we should wander between the two, there are times for both.There are many permutations of the above. We must recognize them, like different lines of play in chess, and see as far out as reasonable possible. There are heuristics that help us approach uncertainty, but we shouldn‚Äôt rely on them. I hope to live my life not choosing binary modes of action, but by seeing n variables of the spectrum and strategically straddling the line, finding the global point of maximization.I don‚Äôt actually know where I was going with this or if I characterized it well.",No date
